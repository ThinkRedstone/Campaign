Getting out of the nine demonic domains is difficult. 

Avernus is the lowest, least desirable of the nine domain- the furthest from the 
Normal plane. To get to the Normal plane, you need to break through the barrier 
separating you current domain from the one above it, until you reach the last
domain and break through to the Normal Plane.

# Avernus

First level of the nine demonic domains, and the most populated.
Also known as the Crater of Damned Souls. Or just "The Crater".

When the gods don't like you, they kill you. But if they _really_ don't like you,
in a world in which death is not as permanent as it should be, they instead 
dump you in the most hostile and inescapable place in the planes of creation:
Avernus.

## Appearance 
The ground is mostly black. The whole area is gently sloping down like a giant
crater. There are a lot of rivers, not all are water. Most of the flora is in 
shades of dark red.

## Getting Out
In the middle of Avernus there is a `thing`, which leads to the next domain.
It might be cool to have each domain end in some sort of psychological
challenge.

## City of Nelghas
A big city, surrounded by walls, on the edge of a cliff. It is one the few bastions of sanity in
Avernus, on the outskirts of the level- as far from the pass as you reasonably
get. It houses mostly damned souls, looking for solace in their last days.

The city is sparsely populated in comparison to its size.
The walls are much thicker than is usual, and surround the city from all
directions- including the sheer cliff at the very edge.

Below the cliff, there are rolling hills. Grain and a little livestock is
cultivated at the base of the cliff, under guard. There is a passage there
from near the city, outside the walls.

The most common threat is that of demons and devils, mostly mindless variants,
which stalk the region as a whole.

### Leader: Gan Distantshine
Elf, damned to Avernus because he massacred the most of the Church of Obelisk,
about `long time` ago. This led to Obelisk personally arriving in the Normal
Plane, which is a very rare occasion since he generally doesn't intervene, much
less so punish. 
For the most part, no one knows this. 

Considered a very capable leader, he leads Nelgahs through the chaos in Avernus.

Can be connected to Asaf's PC. Maybe he recognizes him?

Punishing him curries favour with Obelisk.

A follower of Naru, he massacred the church in the name of justice- To delay
Obelisk and prevent him from `something related to the True Blade of Obelisk`.

### The Broken Window
Located to the right of the main street which extends outside the gatehouse.

The only tavern at Nelgahs. Owned by hot-headed *Lewis*. 

Current barmaid is *Aya Korem*, a meter sixty and then some, green eyes and
almost-black hair. She is unsettled by how the previous barman lost his life,
but she is desperate for the job- Broldon was like a brother to her, and without
him she has no one to turn to. Lewis offred her the job because he thought it
might help her cope with the loss.

Previous barman is *Broldon Moltenflower*, a Dwarf, which died in an uncertain way, Gan 
claiming the hands of a Demon which infiltrated Nelgahs. He considers himself
a Brother to Aya, and she considers him the same, even though they are not
related by blood. He was a bandit, and took Aya in after her parents died
in a raid (they were both also bandits with his party). He and Aya were thrown 
to Avernus because they (and their party) `did something to offend Aton-Ka`.


# The Order of Blades

## The Campaign 
This formalization is here for you Nimrod.

Naru's Campaign, also known within his order as The Campaign, is the Pathfinder
Campaign's main story (at least for now). His Campaign against the gods is driven by his
understanding that the gods, in their endless life and unrivaled power, will
cause and already are causing more injustice than any mortal will ever be able
to. This is a variation on the question of "How can a benevolent god create a
world filled with so much evil?"- How can "good gods" allow their peers to cause
so much misery? Naru's answer is The Campaign. Even though mortal are not just
by the slightest, their injustices are limited by their trivial power, and so
Naru believes the world will be more just if left solely in mortal hands.

## Ranks
The ranks of members in the order are named after different types of straight
blades:
- Dagger
- Sword
- Longsword
- Rapier
- Greatsword

The ranks were created because Outrok created magical greatswords, in fashion of Naru's
True Blade, for all the important members Naru recruited to the order;
to allow them to more easily travel and communicate. Because they all carried
greatswords, they came to be known as Greatswords, and then lesser members
started calling themselves after shorter swords- "I'm no Greatsword, I'm barely a dagger"-
until the current hierarchy was established.

## Nelghas
- Longsword Gan Distantshine
- 2 unnamed dead Daggers
- 1 surviving Dagger

## Enroute to Nelghas
- 2 unnamed Daggers
- 1 Sword tracker

## Greatswords

### Outrok the Lich

Appearance: A floating figure with light blue skin, wearing a white flowing
robe.
Theme: [Wrath of the Lich King Title Screen](https://youtu.be/_1XKOJN_Rp8)

The logistical planner for the Order of Blades. He turned into a lich long ago
to have the power to exact revenge on a king who has wronged him. After the deed
was done, he kept on living, dissatisfied with how the world kept on being
unjust. He was later recruited by Naru, when he first began his current campaign,
and operates out of his lair the logistics of the Order. He personally created 
the physical Greatswords for all the Greatsword members. 

Another option is that he made Naru's True Blade his Phylactery 

### Urian the Blademaster

Appearance: Usually in full plate, an old human with white hair and scarred
face.
Theme: [Legends of Azeroth Remix](https://youtu.be/8ZgH8onTMWY)

A senior blademaster for an `important ciy lord, maybe church`, he fought in the name of
his city for a dozen years. After am horrific battle, in which his city lord and
most of his comrades have died, he gave up. "What's the point to this useless
squabble? How is this justice?". Naru then revealed himself to Urian, and
promised him to let him fight for real justice.

He is one of the older Greatswords in terms of percentage of his natural
lifespan, and curries great influence with Naru- Naru thinks he is the
Greatsword that best understands what true justice is.


### Malen the Champion

Appearance: Full plate, young human with black hair and blue eyes.
Theme: [Stormwind](https://youtu.be/DUA1B3A1ZnY)

The youngest Greatsword, he was born to members of the order, and dedicated
himself from birth to Justice and the Great Campaign. A charismatic young
figure full of passion. Usually less sheltered then most people think.

### Grotrur the Dwarven King

Appearance: Full plate, with an iron crown welded into the helmet. dwarf with red hair and an impressive beard.
Theme: [Ironforge](https://youtu.be/GnuryDgYUZs)

The king of a `dwarven city`, he was taught that a King's duty is to his people
and he should protect them, for any cost. That same teacher later usurped him,
and Grotrur barely escaped with his life. He prayed for justice and protection
for his people, and Naru answered.

Very protective of members in the Order, he sees it as a personal failure every
time a member dies. His city openly supports the order, and through it a lot
of the equipment and financing of the Order occurs.

### Aire the Ritualist

Appearance: An elf wearing a white robe, marked with many arcane symbols (and
of course the Halo).

A genius magician, he does not excel in combat- but rather in his ritual magic
and his utility. Still, his extremist views alienate the other Greatswords- he
believes that the unjust should be hunted and killed, no matter how small the
injustice. Naru disapproves of this bloodthirst, but insists that Aire's talents
are necessary for the Campaign.

### Sabathiel the Angel

Appearance: The tallest Greatsword, Sabathiel stands at 2.5 meters tall. He has a
golden Halo, and two white feathered wings. 

Sabathiel was personally summoned by Naru to hunt the Blades he does not know
the location of- this is because he is amongst the best trackers that ever
exited. Sabathiel is conflicted with The Campaign- on the one hand, as a being
of pure good, he agrees that the gods are definitely not good; but he finds the
idea of killing them difficult- he find the idea of killing anyone difficult,
and irreplaceable and old being such as the gods even more so.
He is also the least bloodthirsty among the Greatswords- his long existence and
his natural tendency to do the most good he can at any point have gotten him
pretty close to pacifism, for a major general in an armed force.

### Orpip Kindriver, the Charmer

Appearance: A Gnome in white tunic, if he has to fulfil some sort of official
function. Will not wear the robes otherwise under any circumstance.

`Maybe change back story so Orpip is still the same charmer, but has a reason to
serve Naru? Not sure I like having a Greatsword who doesn't believe in the
Campaign`
Orpip wasn't looking for justice- he was looking for challenge. Ever the charmer, he
worked his way up the ladder in the Order of Blades to prove he could. Now that
he is finished, he has no way of getting out- he feels stuck, with no way of
escaping the Order now that he proved he could be a Greatsword if he put his
mind to it.

Naru knows this, of course, but since Orpip could get this far, he figures his
talent is worth hanging on to.

### Ains Wind

Appearance: A tall blond woman with straight blonde hair. Wears a white
sleeveless dress under light armor and carries a rapier.

Born to the the blademaster of a large city, Ains was taught by her father about 
swordfighting from a young age. Her father enjoyed teaching her martial arts,
but ultimatly did not want to send his only daughter to serve in the army, and
persuaded her to take a clerical position within the city. Ains was unsatisified
with this, and soon she graviated to hunting monsters and bandits, instead.
When her father found out about this, they had a fight, and ultimatly she decided 
to run away. She was recruited into the Order, where her incredible talent with 
the sword as well as her experience with adventuring got her promoted fairly quickly,
and she got the highest rank of Greatsword within only 2 years.

Bell is infatuated with her in a way only a teenager can with another teenager.

## Other Members of Note

### Bell Trueflame
`This is basically ripping off DanMachi, but who cares`
Theme: [Heroic Desire](https://youtu.be/pWlfyXi0KYs)

This young man, about 17 years of age, was personally picked by Naru- but no one
knows why. He wasn't orphaned- he didn't live on the streets and see the harshness 
of the world. He was no soldier, sickened by war and pushed to pursue justice. 
He was not born in the order, he has no experience
with why justice is required. But for some reason most of the order struggles to
understand, Naru picked up this specific boy to join his Order and lavishes
undue attention on him. This has caused the Order to alienate Bell quite a lot,
and Bell in turn feels unworthy.

But Naru picked Bell for a reason- out of all of his Order and all of his
Greatswords, Bell is the truest Hero. He wasn't betrayed, abandoned, raised or 
threatened. He is, of his own volition, always trying to help those who need
help. He doesn't care what light it paints him. He doesn't do it because he
knows how it feels to need help and receive none. He does it because his heart
tells him it is the right thing to do, because he is a true hero.

Naru understands that his Campaign can only end with him dead. He knows the
chaos and pain his campaign will bring the world in the short term. He picked
Bell because he knows, deep in his heart, that himself too is a menace upon the
world. He knows he will never, no matter how he justifies The Campaign, be as
good as Bell. And when it is done, he wants Bell to be there.

I think Naru should think of Bell as his son- This kinda feats Bell Cranel and
Hestia, but also Naru views Bell as a version of himself that can live up to be
what Naru never could, because Naru needs to do what needs to be done.
