Batu Monastery
--------------

Founded around 300 years ago, circa 1000 ACE.
Founded by a non religious hermit, who slowly gathered followers- a martial monastery.
When a :ref:`sraqtat` monk arrived, they liked how with enough undestanding, even
if it is beyond human comprehension, you can predict the flow of the universe, like you can 
for a battle. The future is but a magnificent stratagem, layed down by Sraqtat aeon ago.

Rite of Passage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a rite of passage, monks looking to advanced are sent out into the world, to find a facet of
Sraqtat's stratagem, and advance it. Since they're looking to understand his Grand Strategy, this 
is also useful to gather information about it in order to better understand it.

The Order
---------

He travled to Shynore, and from there as he worked as a deckhand on a voyage to Cloudhall. In Cloudhall,
he tried to find work as a mercenery, and Ains picked him up- when he heared about The Order, it piqued
his curiosity, and he joined and helped Ains for a few missions, ending with her mission in Acorghas.
