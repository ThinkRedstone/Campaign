## Chapter 1: The City of Nelghas

### Scene 1: Start
*Aton-ka*, appearing as an old elf, is standing and looking away.

He `tells some info`, and then dies and disintegrates.
"We are surrounded by death. Seek Nelghas, where death is the least imminent"
"I cannot help you, children, for I cannot delay the natural process. But I wish
you all to live what you are given to the fullest, and pass on."

He points party to Nelghas.

They reach Nelghas.

### Scene 2: Nelghas
In Nelghas the guards tell them to talk with Gan Distantshine.

Distantshine is helping unload a wagon near a storage room. 
He has a proposition- he want the party to kill a devil that
has infiltrated Nelghas, in exchange for favour. 

This is where a religion / history check might arouse suspicion. 

Either they research him, or they kill the Zebub before he fights with Gan 
Distantshine.

### Scene 3: Peyton the Jester at the Laughing Snake
The oldest person in town is the dwarf Peyton the Jester,
which runs the only apothecary.

He was a bandit that unfortunately robbed a
convoy headed by high ranking priest, 
and his whole gang got here. 
He remembers that when Gal arrived,
he was sprayed in blood, and carried a 
large emblem depicting a setting golden sun 
(symbol of obelisk), also bloodied.
