## Chapter 1: The City of Nelghas

### Scene 1: Start
*Aton-ka*, appearing as an old elf, is standing and looking away.

He `tells some info`, and then dies and disintegrates.
"We are surrounded by death. Seek Nelghas, where death is the least imminent"
"I cannot help you, children, for I cannot delay the natural process. But I wish
you all to live what you are given to the fullest, and pass on."

He points party to Nelghas.

They reach Nelghas.

### Scene 2: Nelghas
In Nelghas the guards tell them to talk with Gan Distantshine.

Distantshine is helping unload a wagon near a storage room. 
He has a proposition- he want the party to kill a devil that
has infiltrated Nelghas, in exchange for favour. 

This is where a religion / history check might arouse suspicion. 

Either they research him, or they kill the Zebub before he fights with Gan 
Distantshine.

### Scene 3: Peyton the Jester at the Laughing Snake
The oldest person in town is the dwarf Peyton the Jester,
which runs the only apothecary.

He was a bandit that unfortunately robbed a
convoy headed by high ranking priest, 
and his whole gang got here. 
He remembers that when Gal arrived,
he was sprayed in blood, and carried a 
large emblem depicting a setting golden sun 
(symbol of obelisk), also bloodied.

### Side note: A message from Aton-Ka
Ulla feels his holy symbol grow hot. When praying for guidance with it, he 
would get the following message: "The Demonic Domains house no innocents. The light might appear
righteous, but it is blinding."

### Scene 4: The search for the Demon
The dead barman is *Broldon Moltenflower*. He died shortly before the party
arrived. He was found in the building he called home by Aya, which is his
sister. His body was taken, and Gan should know where it is. There is a two-tier
system here, where a very high medicine check should reveal that he died from a
sword wound in the back, and then someone made it appear like he was ravaged by
claws. A lower roll will only tell them about the claw marks.

Aya never saw the claw marks, since Gan added them after he got custody of the
body. She also knows he was a devoted follower of Obelisk- a priest magician.
When pressed, she might remember that he behaved weirdly before he was killed-
he was greatly disturbed by something.

Inside Broldon's house, you can use detect magic to find the remnants of some
magic has been cast. A letter under a loose tile reads: "You know how dangerous
he is. You know what he has done. We implore you, use your talents and rid the
world of his presence. All things must end, and his time has passed." It is
signed with the symbol of Obelisk. There are also some commponents that a
religion check will verify are part of a summoning ritual.

## Chapter 2: The Struggle for Bertha

### Scene xxx: Naru apologizing for Gan's behaviour

Naru is sitting on a rock at the side of the road, with Bertha across his lap, and his
halo of weapons at the smallest he considers sufficient- ten swords, all resting
on the rock around him. He apologizes for Gan's behaviour.
