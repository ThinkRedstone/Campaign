<p>In abyssal, Acor: Temple, Ghas:  City. Temple City. Other options
for Acor are Redemption, Tower, and Sword.</p>
<p>The first city after <a class="reference internal" href="Nelghas.html#nelghas"><span class="std std-ref">Nelghas</span></a>.
It is built on the edge of the <span class="xref std std-ref">Inner Crater</span>, where <a class="reference internal" href="../gods.html#abbadon"><span class="std std-ref">Abbadon</span></a> broke
it and faced <a class="reference internal" href="../gods.html#naru"><span class="std std-ref">Naru</span></a>, the city built around and slightly into the passage.</p>
<p>The sheer cliff of the Inner Crater is the first thing visible, as well as the
white light above Acorghas. As you get closer, the giant gap in the cliff as
well as the giant white light burning above the city become apparent. In the
middle of the gap in the cliff, stands a giant tower, about half the height of
the cliffs to either side. Above the tower and the cliffs, nearly as big as the
city walls, there is a giant halo made of white flame.</p>
<p>The city is sprawled to the foot of the tower, a complex of stone buildings that
become more and more wooden and provisional as you reach the far side of the
wall.</p>
<p>The wall itself is about half as high as <a class="reference internal" href="Nelghas.html#nelghas"><span class="std std-ref">Nelghas</span></a>’s wall, standing at 5
meters high. It lacks the magical inner working of Nelghas’s wall, which means
it is not nearly as wide (about 2 meters wide).</p>
<p>The gates are local wood strengthened with steel, adorned in the middle with
Abbadon’s symbol made of bronze (which also looks like a silhouette of the
city).</p>
</section>
<section id="demographic">
<h2>Demographic<a class="headerlink" href="#demographic" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The city is composed by about 50% redeemed demons. Most of the rest are exiled mortals,
who have somehow made their way to Acorghas. More rarely, monsters seek Acorghas
of their own volition, in their quest for redemption.</p>
<p>The redeemed demons are mostly fervent followers of Abbadon, some of them redeemed by
his own hand.</p>

<p>“Left” and “Right” are relative to when looking at the city from the Outer Crater,
that is, towards the plains and hills, opposite to the cliff of the Inner Crater
and direction of the center.</p>
<p>In general, the closer you are to the Temple, the more desirable the land,
And quarters are arranged more-or-less in semi-circle tiers around the Tower.</p>
<section id="the-temple-tower">
<span id="the-tower"></span><h3>The Temple Tower<a class="headerlink" href="#the-temple-tower" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The tower in the middle of the city is a temple to Abbadon. It hollow inside,
leaving the central space with a view all the way to the sky. In the middle of
this central hall there is the True Blade of Abbadon, which is a flaming longsword.
It is embedded to the middle of the blade into plain rock rising from the floor.</p>
<p>From the roof it is plain to see that the Halo above Acorghas actually centers
on the Temple and not the city.</p>
<p>The priests are mostly local demons, though there are some humans.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Shina Mudur</strong> (human f): Latest in joining the Lampart Conjecture. It is
implied being wild and sleeping with randoms is part of her Redemption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulen Urira</strong> (elf m): An elf priest that tries to behave high and mighty but is
actually very lazy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annor</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=6982&amp;name=wood_giant&amp;optional=optundefined#!">wood giant</a> m): He was captured young and brought to the fighting
pits in the south-west, where he grew up as a slave-gladiator. He was very
popular, bought his freedom, and worked his way up all the way to the Arena of
Perseverance. There, old and weary, he fought another young wood giant, raised in
the pits like himself. He killed the young contender, but this senseless
bloodshed broke his will- and he sought redemption, swearing to hurt no one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enam Nala</strong> (human m): A man in his 40s, he has grey hair and wears no beard. He has wise grey eyes,
and a serenity that envelops him. Before he redeemed himself he was a general in <a class="reference internal" href="../gods.html#edon"><span class="std std-ref">Edon</span></a>’s army,
and helped him conquer. When war broke him, he swore to help man find the right path again and joined
the priesthood.
He was recently selected by Abbadon to lead the priesthood, and although for the priests themselves
Abbadon’s word is law, many in the general public of demons think he lacks the ability to
properly redeem their kind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jennakoth</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3588&amp;name=cacodaemon_(harvester_daemon)">Cacodaemon</a> m): A demon priest serving on the court of the fallen. Has an old flare,
he likes to get to the bottom of the cases brought before him.</p></li>

<h3>Tower Quarter<a class="headerlink" href="#tower-quarter" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The area immediately
around the tower is known as the <strong>Tower Quarter</strong> or the <strong>First Quarter</strong>. It is the oldest
quarter, being built even before the Tower itself, to house Abbadon’s first Redeemed followers.
Most buildings has been since rebuilt to a more luxurious standard, but some of the original
buildings (and their original inhabitants) still remain.</p>
</section>
<section id="red-quarter">
<h3>Red Quarter<a class="headerlink" href="#red-quarter" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This quarter is named for the color of its buildings, which is mostly red and gold- the colors
of Abbadon. It houses mostly Redeemed demons and demon businesses, which are all followers of
Abbadon and so often flaunt his colors.</p>
<p>It is placed behind and to the left of the <a class="reference internal" href="#tower-quarter">Tower Quarter</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="exiles-quarter">
<h3>Exiles Quarter<a class="headerlink" href="#exiles-quarter" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The quarter is named for its demographic, predominantly normal mortals and monsters
that have been exiled to <a class="reference internal" href="../old_setting.html#avernus"><span class="std std-ref">Avernus</span></a>. This quarter is not as rich as the Red or Tower
quarters, but it is still fairly well put- most of the reputable businesses in the
city are housed in this quarter. Though some Redeemed demons do live in this quarter, they
tend to be the ones who are less fervent, and more interested in leading “mortal”
lives.</p>
<p>It is placed in the same tier as the <a class="reference internal" href="#red-quarter">Red Quarter</a>, to its right.</p>

<p>The Vindication Stockade  is Acorghas’s jail and courtroom. It is located in the exile’s quarter,
on the border with the red and tower quarters. It is a large and chunky stone building, surrounded with a wooden
wall. It is also the Headquarters for Acorghas’s guard.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Morfir Lelonn</strong> (elf m)- Commander of the Guard. A very tired-looking elf with blonde hair and relatively pale skin. He is very calm
and collected, generally sitting behind his desk reading reports and filling paperwork. He greatly misses the Great Forest, but he is
too wrapped up in duty for him to notice it. He was once a leader of a “bandit” group, hunting people that hurt his Forest, at the
blessing of <a class="reference internal" href="../gods.html#behemoth"><span class="std std-ref">Behemoth</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kagi Starbreaker</strong> (human f)- Second in Command. A very pretty, and surprisingly young woman with black hair tied in a pony tail
with a ribbon. She and Morfir have a very close relationship while handling the Guard, with him handling the planning and logistics
and her taking care of execution of the plans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boker</strong> (zebub m)- A demon employed by the guard. Arrested Lampart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kazor</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=41">barghest</a> f)- A demon Watch Officer that was on duty for the area in the Exiles quarter in which the Severed Horn is located.

<section id="procedure">
<h4>Procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#procedure" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Generally, those convicted of grave offenses are simply exiled “until they find their Redemption”,
so the Vindication Stockade doesn’t serve as a prison.</p>
<p><strong>The Court of the Fallen</strong> hands out judgment, and it is staffed mostly by
the <a class="reference internal" href="#acorghas-priesthood">Acorghas Priesthood</a>, but sometimes other members of note is Acorghas that are not strictly priests.
The seniority of the member of the court judging a case is correlated to the severity of the offense.</p>
<p>The court also follows the “rule of mortality”: you can only be judged by someone with the same
life expectancy (elves can’t judge humans, but they can judge gnomes- demons only judge demons
and ageless monsters, and for monsters it varies depending on the type).</p>
<p>The court’s official job is to “guide the fallen towards their redemption”- this is where
it draws its name from, why it is mostly staffed by priests, and why they follow the
rule of mortality. <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3"><span id="id1"></span>[#]_</span></a></p>

<strong>Hornless Arnus</strong>.</p>
<p>Arnus was once a normal Minotaur, living with his tribe in the
underground caverns <em>somewhere</em>. He led normal Minotaur life, preying on miners and
other passers-by, until at some point his clan became too much of a nuisance and
adventurers and soldiers were sent to eradicate it. Bloodied and running for his life with
one horn broken, Arnus understood for the first time the feelings he caused in
his prey. He cut off his other horn, and from there sought redemption.</p>
<p>He appears tall and muscular, covered in brown fur. From the sides of his head, above
his cow-like ears, two horn stumps emerge- The left one has a rough and uneven end, while
the right one is clean-cut.</p>

a massive counter, a full meter and a half above the floor, and behind that shelves with bottles

There is a big display space, housing a big wooden shield with a big curved horn.</p>

<p>This is a magical armor and items shop located in the <a class="reference internal" href="#tower-quarter">Tower Quarter</a>. It looks out of place,
a small squat building of gray stone and a large chimney, with an open front revealing a large
but short forge, with anvils and barrels sunk into the ground.
On the inside, one wall is filled with shelves lined with items, and the other three walls are lined
with suites of armor and shields.</p>
<p>Astrog is a <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1111">Brimorak</a> demon. As such, he is about 1m high. He looks very muscular, and wears
a large belt with various hammers and smithing tools hanging from it. On the bottom of his
feet, he wears large metal blocks, which surround his hoofs and prevent them from burning.</p>
<p>He is blacksmith and magicsmith, specializing in creating magical armor and
tools. He is especially known for creating fire-resistant armor.</p>
<p>He was originally created at <a class="reference internal" href="../oneshots/cruel_age_oneshot.html#jeles"><span class="std std-ref">Jeles</span></a>, shortly after <a class="reference internal" href="../oneshots/cruel_age_oneshot.html#gaedon"><span class="std std-ref">Gaedon</span></a> turned, which makes him one of
the oldest demons in existence. The task given to him and his kin, when they were created,
was to burn Jeles to the ground- they turned the whole city into an inferno, burning it and
its inhabitants to cinders. As part of Abbadon’s host, he burned great cities and ancient forests-
fields of grain lush hillsides. City walls were turned to fire-traps, homes into infernos.</p>
<p>In the battle that marked the end of the Cruel Age, Astrog survived, and was soon redeemed by
Abbadon’s hand. The screams of burning mortals and the view of ancient tree burning as their inhabitants
jump off of them still haunt him, which is why he focuses on armor and tools to combat fires.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Inspired by Critical Role, C2E1-4: Small Girl with broken voice adopted by big and scary demon.
I wrote Hezrou because that’s a frog monster like in CR, but for balance reasons a Ceustodaemon might be more appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Toya Deepheart</strong> is an orphan dwarven girl about the age of 12. She was exiled with
her father to Avernus at the age of 6, but he died shortly after fending off a <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=601">Hezrou</a>.
Her voice is badly damaged, she sounds hoarse permanently.</p>
<p><strong>Kylre</strong> (Kyle Ree) is a <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=601">Hezrou</a> and Toya’s adoptive father. He was redeemed by caring for Toya after killing her father.</p>
<p>The story goes thus: Soon after Toya and her father arrived in Avernus, Kylre- at this point not Redeemed- found a tasty meal in them.
Her father fought Kylre and instructed her to run, and so she did, crying all the while,
breaking her voice until it would never heal. After consuming her father, Kylre gave chase, looking to finish
his meal with a snack- but when he cornered Toya, sitting on the floor with a twisted ankle, her
back to a tree and a monster looming over her, all she could was cry for her father. Encountering this
tiny, crying form, Kylre was puzzled- he decided to save the snack for later. Over the next few months,
Kylre began to redeem himself- always “saving the snack for later”, he fed Toya and defended her.
Eventually, he realized he is no longer the demon he once was, and made his way to Acorghas, where
he now lives with Toya.</p>
<p>This make Kylre a 1st generation Redeemed demon, without Abbadon’s influence (which should be quite rare).</p>
