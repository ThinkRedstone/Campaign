Kinlodar
========

This city serves as the base of operations for The Order, and is ruled by a Greatsword- 
:ref:`Grotrur the Dwarven King`. Most administrative, recruitment, and manufacturing for
the order happens in this city. 

City Stuff
----------

City Symbol: The Deep Chasm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circle with a spiral fading towards the middle of the circle, representing a very deep chasm.

City Guard: The Brother's Watch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Composed almost completely of dwarves. Uniformed in brown.


Structure
---------

The city is located on the edge of the **Negrogh Mountains**, where they meet The Ocean. 
It is composed of three giant terraces, fanning out from the side of the mountain and over
The Ocean, forming three tiers connected via staircases and elevators. The city is accessable
mostly via tunnels through the mountains, leading to highland hunting grounds, mountain rivers,
and other dwarven cities. 

Despite the proximity to The Ocean, the city conducts very little trade via seafairing- even the
Low Tier about 200m above sealevel, making the transport of goods to sea difficult, as well
as the maintenance of any sizeable port.

The High Tier Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The High Tier, which is the smallest, is the administrative center of the city- The Palace, 
:ref:`Outrok's <Outrok the Lich>` workshop (de facto central administration for The Order), 
the Kin's Guard headquarters and other important institutes are placed here. Here, 
the demographic is most diverse, as members of the Order as well as merchants from faraway places
mingle with the mostly-dwarven natives.

Architecture is mostly white stone with red tiled roofs, and is mostly for dwarves despite the demographic.


The Middle Tier Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Middle Tier is mostly residential, serving mainly as residence for people working in the High Tier
who don't wish to commute from the Low Tier. It houses high-to-mid income families, but most commercial 
activity is relegated to the Low Tier, with the exception being inns, which flourish due to the influx
of visitors to the city seeking buisness in the High Tier.


The Low Tier Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Low Tier is the lowest and the biggest terrace, divided into three quarters. It is also home to the main market,
the **Iron Market**, named so for the larget volume of metals traded therein.


The Low Tier
------------

The Iron Market
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The central market and economic heart of Kinlodar. It is placed in the center of the Low Tier, bordering the `Hanging Docks`
on the south-west (towards the middle of the edge of Kinlodar). Originally, this was where the first refineries were built
when Kinlodar was founded, which is were the market draws its name from; Popular opinion however attributes the name to
the large quantity of metal and metal products traded therein- many saying that over half the world's metal has been traded in
this market.


Eye of the Beholder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A book and magical supplies shop, manned by a sentient set of (very jolly) `Clone Mirrors`_ named **M**.
When you enter, a clone of yourself steps out of one of the many mirrors and heads the shop. 
There is also a spindly half-elven assistant named **Gabrian Grevyre**, which the mirrors sometimes
clone if there is no one else there. This is mostly his only job, to give the mirrors something to clone
that has digits.

There are 5 mirrors, however one of them is lost at city, on the bottom of The Ocean, leaving four
in the shop.

**Location**: The Iron Market, Low Tier

The Leaky Cauldron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A medium inn and tavern, with a dwarven barkeep named **Belmor Strezzen**.
He has deep understanding of drinks and their history. The owner of the place
is a human lady by the name of **Sone Deshtik**, with faint elven heritage and a
relaxed, homely air.

**Location**: Low Tier, near western edge

Bountyful Wilds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A herbs, oinments and illicit drugs shop. Run by a dwarf named **Urmron Grollavon**, which talks with a
weird tick and has a liking to children's dexterity toys.

**Location**: Low Tier, outskirts of the Iron Market

The Sweltering Revel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pub serving as Kinlodar's natural ground for underworld business. Owned by **San Sikreg**, a human male.

The Hanging Docks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kinlodar's only port- much smaller than might be expected of a sea city this size, due to the technical complexity involved.
The Docks hang from their mooring to the bottom of the Low Tier on chains that extend all the way down the surface of the Ocean,
and cranes and elevators bring people and cargo to and fro.  

**Location**: Low Tier, south-western edge (middle of the edge)

The Isoi Temple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A rectangular building with Cathedral look- great many spires and statues and purple-and-gold decoration.
The front is always crowded with people looking to use the temple facilites. To the left of the 
doorway, there is a big board which displays the fair market values of various commodities and stocks in golden
letters. The board is updated as the temple gets requests to buy or sell, sometimes
multiple times an hour.

**Location**: Low Tier, bordering the Iron Market, towards the mountain (away from the edge)

The High Tier
-------------

Aton-Ka Temple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The oldest temple in Kinlodar, it was built during the Cruel Age, and honors Aton-Ka as a dwarf- his form
at the time- and not his later elven form. 

The Palace 
~~~~~~~~~~~

todo

Bharmore Noblechest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A female dwarf with unkempt brown hair and a motherly attitude but an adventurous streak. Member of :ref:`The Pathfinder Society`.
Her house is full of unorganized expirements left untouched for months at a time, rolled up maps, books,
and currently- one extra-large cradle filled with dirt, housing a budding `Giant Flytrap <https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=209>`_.
She has been to **Unnan** and has seen their tattoos, and despite her inexperience, is willing to try.

Quest Board
-----------

The Questlord of Kinlodar, a dwarven female by the name of **Mardora Caedareck**, tracks request from the 
Dwarf-King of Kinlodar as well as merchants or other people looking for hired help. She keeps a few boards
through out Kinlodar updated.

These are things the city might hire adventurers to do.
**It will also offer a reward for anyone turning in smugglers of illegal Direwolf pelts or other products.**

History
-------


BCA
~~~

Kinlodar was built before the Cruel Age, the High and Low tiers completed at around 300 BCA. The Negrogh mountain range has
an ancient history of dwarven inhibition, but during the dawn of The Empire at around 1000 BCA, mining operation in the range
shifted into high gear, when their dwarven occupants turned to weapon smithing to supply the ongoing conflict. However, mining
efforts where limited by the ability to transfer the ore from the mining sites to the smelters, necessitating a more direct approach-
Kinlodar was originally constructed to house all the smelting equipment as close as possible to the mines, hence its
counter-intuitive location floating in the air on the side of a mountain. The Low tier was planned to house the smelters and storage,
and the High tier as residence for miners- many of the High Tier building still stand today, which is why their clearly uniform in style
and built for dwarves.

Kinlodar was technically admitted into the Empire when the dwarven kingdom surrendered to The Empire, but this happened
only a few weeks before the Dawn of the Cruel Age.

*There can be a fun fact here, if someone says Kinlodar is the only Ever-free city, and the lore corrects him that this is false*

Cruel Age
~~~~~~~~~

During the Cruel Age, Kinlodar ceased operations as smelting facility, as it flooded with refugees escaping into the Negrogh mountains
in hopes that Abbadon's Army will not find them; and in general this proved true, with the Terraces of Kinlodar one of the few **Great
Constructions** that still stand today. It is during this period that the former Dwarf-King **Hjolmar Lightguard**
also fled to Kinlodar, and re-established his kingdom as a city-state. The modern Dwarf-King of Kinlodar can still trace his lineage to Hjolmar,
and through him to the First Dwarf-King.

PCA
~~~

After the Cruel Age, Kinlodar became one of the biggest cities in Cadel`Kra- the influx of refugees changed the demographic of the city dramatically, 
and so led to the Low Tier being permanently re-purposed for more mixed-species residence.
