Kinlodar
========

This city serves as the base of operations for The Order, and is ruled by a Greatsword- 
:ref:`Grotrur the Dwarven King`. Most administrative, recruitment, and manufacturing for
the order happens in this city.

Strcture
--------

The city is located on the edge of the **Negrogh Mountains**, where they meet The Ocean. 
It is composed of three giant terraces, fanning out from the side of the mountain and over
The Ocean, forming three tiers connected via staircases and elevators. The city is accessable
mostly via tunnels through the mountains, leading to highland hunting grounds, mountain rivers,
and other dwarven cities. 

Despite the proximity to The Ocean, the city conducts very little trade via seafairing- even the
Low Tier about 200m above sealevel, making the transport of goods to sea difficult, as well
as the maintenance of any sizeable port.

The High Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The High Tier, which is the smallest, is the administrative center of the city- The Palace, 
:ref:`Outrok's <Outrok the Lich>` workshop (de facto central administration for The Order), 
the Kin's Guard headquarters and other important institutes are placed here. Here, 
the demographic is most diverse, as members of the Order as well as merchants from faraway places
mingle with the mostly-dwarven natives.

Architecture is mostly white stone with red tiled roofs, and is mostly for dwarves despite the demographic.

The Middle Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Middle Tier is mostly residential, serving mainly as residence for people working in the High Tier
who don't wish to commute from the Low Tier. It houses high-to-mid income families, but most commercial 
activity is relegated to the Low Tier, with the exception being inns, which flourish due to the influx
of visitors to the city seeking buisness in the High Tier.

The Low Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Low Tier is the lowest and the biggest terrace, divided into three quarters. It is also home to the main market,
the **Iron Market**, named so for the larget volume of metals traded therein.

Bookie Lookie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A book and magical supplies shop, manned by a sentient set of (very jolly) `Clone Mirrors`_.
When you enter, a clone of yourself steps out of one of the many mirrors and heads the shop. 
There is also a spindly half-elven assistant named **Gabrian Grevyre**, which the mirrors sometimes
clone if there is no one else there. This is mostly his only job, to give the mirrors something to clone
that has digits.

Quest Board
-----------

These are things the city might hire adventurers to do.
**It will also offer a reward for anyone turning in smugglers of illegal Direwolf pelts or other products.**

- Clear old mining shafts from dangerous minotour clans
- Guard shipping caravens on their subterranean journey through the Negrogh range to other dwarven cities

History
-------


BCA
~~~

Kinlodar was built before the Cruel Age, the High and Low tiers completed at around 300 BCA. The Negrogh mountain range has
an ancient history of dwarven inhibition, but during the dawn of The Empire at around 1000 BCA, mining operation in the range
shifted into high gear, when their dwarven occupants turned to weapon smithing to supply the ongoing conflict. However, mining
efforts where limited by the ability to transfer the ore from the mining sites to the smelters, necessitating a more direct approach-
Kinlodar was originally constructed to house all the smelting equipment as close as possible to the mines, hence its
counter-intuitive location floating in the air on the side of a mountain. The Low tier was planned to house the smelters and storage,
and the High tier as residence for miners- many of the High Tier building still stand today, which is why their clearly uniform in style
and built for dwarves.

Kinlodar was technically admitted into the Empire when the dwarven kingdom surrendered to The Empire, but this happened
only a few weeks before the Dawn of the Cruel Age.

*There can be a fun fact here, if someone says Kinlodar is the only Ever-free city, and the lore corrects him that this is false*

Cruel Age
~~~~~~~~~

During the Cruel Age, Kinlodar ceased operations as smelting facility, as it flooded with refugees escaping into the Negrogh mountains
in hopes that Abbadon's Army will not find them; and in general this proved true, with the Terraces of Kinlodar one of the few **Great
Constructions** that still stand today. It is during this period that the former Dwarf-King **Hjolmar Lightguard**
also fled to Kinlodar, and re-established his kingdom as a city-state. The modern Dwarf-King of Kinlodar can still trace his lineage to Hjolmar,
and through him to the First Dwarf-King.

PCA
~~~

After the Cruel Age, Kinlodar became one of the biggest cities in Cadel`Kra- the influx of refugees changed the demographic of the city dramatically, 
and so led to the Low Tier being permanently re-purposed for more mixed-species residence.
