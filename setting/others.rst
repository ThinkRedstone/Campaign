The Pathfinder Society
----------------------

obviously inspired by `Pathfinder Society <https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Society>`_.

The Pathfinders are a society of explorers who venture into the unknown to uncover and 
document wonders and the unseen. Some are in it to advance mortal knowledge, few are in it
in the hopes of finding some great unknown treasure hidden since the Cruel Age, but most are
there for the simple pleasure of discovery.

Structure 
---------

The society has a very loose command structure, since most its members are very free-spirited in nature.
Still, some structure does exist:

Leader
~~~~~~

The Society is headed by **Elnorin Varen**, a kindly old elf lady who hasn't lost the yearn for adventure,
only the ability to act upon it. She is around 550 years old, and her parents were already fully grown when
:ref:`Abbadon` burned down the Living Forest [#]_ that was their home. She oversees the Society in general,
from supplying lodges with what they need to suggesting new targets for expeditions.

.. [#] I should maybe change the name something less generic that works better in Hebrew.


Lodge Masters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under her, there are the Lodge Masters and Mistresses- each of them is in charge of a specific lodge
in some part of the world. They oversee the lodge staff, and help supply, equip and plan new expeditions.

Venture Captains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While not strictly under the Lodge Masters, the next rank is the Venture-Captains. If a pathfinder wants
to set out on a new expedition, he will convince a Lodge Master to approve and supply the expedition. 
The Lodge Master will then name a pathfinder to be Venture-Captain for that expedition, and they will
remain Venture-Captain until the expedition is complete or they cannot continue it.

Pathfinders
~~~~~~~~~~~

The lowest "rank" are the simple pathfinders- the explorers that set out with a Venture-Captain on an expedition.
Pathfinders are entered into the society by completing an expedition with other Pathfinders successfully. 
Thus, aspiring Pathfinders generally seek a lodge- once there, they will convince the Lodge Master and other 
Pathfinders of their usefulness or their potential, in hopes of being included in an expedition. Lodge Masters
often will help train these aspiring Pathfinders, if they think they have potential or otherwise like them.

Sometimes, a Venture-Captain will allow someone to join the expedition outside the lodge, if circumstances demand it.
Regardless of how one joined, once an expedition is completed successfully, the Venture-Captain and the Lodge Master
will commission all the new members of the expedition as Pathfinders.

Lodges
------

The lodges supply pathfinders with services and logistics they might need-
they house lodge-scribes and lodge-cryptographers, and some might also have lodge-magicians
and lodge-blacksmiths, depending on location. The most important service they fulfill in the society
is the collection of reports from pathfinders and their distribution among the society.

Only the lodge staff is associated with the lodge- pathfinders come and go and don't often visit the
same lodge more than once.

Equipment
---------

Pathfinder expeditions are generally equipped depending on the needs of the particular expedition and the decisions of the 
Venture-Captain and Lodge Master. They will however always carry paper, ink and pens- as well as cryptography tools and
astrolabes. The point of any expedition is discovery, and you ain't found nothing if no one knows you did.

Pathfinders are also given two pieces of equipment that they generally always carry- a pocket watch, and their compass.
The pocket watch and compass are necessary both for navigation and the creation of maps, but the compass serves a dual purpose-
besides a needle pointing north, it also has a needle that always points to the nearest lodge.
Pathfinders generally carry both of these on the inner side of a leather bracelet on their left arm, which allows reading them
while holding on to maps or torches.
