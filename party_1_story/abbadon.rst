Outline of Chapter 3: Abbadon and his Blade
===========================================

In chapter 3, Naru's team is trying to get Abbadon's blade out of Acorghas and
into the hands of the Order in preparation of Naru killing him.

Why Is Abbadon Indifferent?
---------------------------

:ref:`Abbadon` knows this is happening- like most of the gods, he is not blind to
Naru's doing. Abbadon simply does not care- recall that Naru gave him the sword, so he
could join :ref:`lilina trueflame` if he ever gave up. Abbadon knows what he did, and
always figured out that he will have to pay the price, that his mistakes will
one day demand their retribution. 

He is not willing to fight fate to extend his life- unlike his followers, he
does not truly believe in his own retribution: he was given burrowed time, to
fix as much as he could, and if fate reckoned his time ran out, he will let
justice run its course.

For this reason, he did not prepare his priesthood, and did not try to stop
Naru. He will also not stop his priesthood from trying to save the sword.

Internally, Abbadon is a widowed old
man, who has spend many lifetimes fixing the mistakes of his younger self and
leading others away from their mistakes. He wishes for an end, to join his love
and rest.
