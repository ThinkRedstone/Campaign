Grust
=====

Background
----------

Bertha
------
Bertha is Grust's beloved weapon. She is a two headed `Orc Necksplitter`_, which is passed down
his orcish family for generations. Unbeknownst to him, Bertha is the True Blade of :ref:`Behemoth`.
He thinks she's alive, and though this is not exactly true, he can feel from Bertha the feelings
of Behemoth.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A two-headed axe with a spike. The blades themselves are black, and the handle is bone-white.
The axe is adorned with gold decorations: At the bladed end towards the center, wolf heads, 
skulls along the center, and at the bottom of the handle towards the blades, flames.


Dream About Behemoth
--------------------

Grust wakes up in an unknown forest.

The forest is unusually silent, and Grust
sees a light up ahead.

Investigating the light reveals a small encampment- walls made of logs,
a watch tower, tents and large tarps. The lights are from their cook fires, and their 
tents that just started catching fire, and around them are strewn dozens of dead humans and elves-
all of them with torn necks or limbs, some of them with fang marks the size of a hand.

At some point Grust looks to his left in the trees and sees a huge_ wolf staring at him in the dark, 
its golden eyes floating 2 meters above the ground, its mouth dripping with blood.
He will then feel words enter his mind, filled with anger and bloodlust: **"Domesticated pup."**.

The dream fades.
