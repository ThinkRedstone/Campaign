Capture The Duck Oneshot
========================

Aboard the Species Union Ship the Flying Nomad, Team 32 is flying for a 
training exercise. Above deck, a shout can be heard "Prepare for star entry!",
and the ship flies through the star-gate into the plane of Evernight.

On the deck of the ship, watching the passage through the star, there is a
**Duck in a Blue Bandana** with the symbol of the Species Union on it.
The plane Evernight is shrouded by eternal night, with the stars and moons 
pressing very close to the ground, the sun missing from the plane altogether.

Approaching the Drow city of **Larano**, the structure of it is clearly visible from above:
A ring of ship-ports surround the buildings of the city proper, which itself is built in a ring,
framing a small forest; a lonely river bisects the city, extending to the distance.
