Acorghas
========

Description
-----------

In abyssal, Acor: Temple, Ghas:  City. Temple City. Other options
for Acor are Redemption, Tower, and Sword.

The first city after :ref:`Nelghas`.
It is built on the edge of the :ref:`Inner Crater`, where :ref:`Abbadon` broke
it and faced :ref:`Naru`, the city built around and slightly into the passage.

The sheer cliff of the Inner Crater is the first thing visible, as well as the
white light above Acorghas. As you get closer, the giant gap in the cliff as
well as the giant white light burning above the city become apparent. In the
middle of the gap in the cliff, stands a giant tower, about half the height of
the cliffs to either side. Above the tower and the cliffs, nearly as big as the
city walls, there is a giant halo made of white flame.

The city is sprawled to the foot of the tower, a complex of stone buildings that
become more and more wooden and provisional as you reach the far side of the
wall.

The wall itself is about half as high as :ref:`Nelghas`'s wall, standing at 5
meters high. It lacks the magical inner working of Nelghas's wall, which means
it is not nearly as wide (about 2 meters wide).

The gates are local wood strengthened with steel, adorned in the middle with 
Abbadon's symbol made of bronze (which also looks like a silhouette of the
city).

Demographic
-----------
The city is composed by about 50% redeemed demons. Most of the rest are exiled mortals,
who have somehow made their way to Acorghas. More rarely, monsters seek Acorghas
of their own volition, in their quest for redemption.

The redeemed demons are mostly fervent followers of Abbadon, some of them redeemed by 
his own hand.


City Structure
--------------
"Left" and "Right" are relative to when looking at the city from the Outer Crater, 
that is, towards the plains and hills, opposite to the cliff of the Inner Crater 
and direction of the center.

In general, the closer you are to the Temple, the more desirable the land,
And quarters are arranged more-or-less in semi-circle tiers around the Tower.


The Temple Tower
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The tower in the middle of the city is a temple to Abbadon. It hollow inside, 
leaving the central space with a view all the way to the sky. In the middle of
this central hall there is the True Blade of Abbadon, which is a flaming longsword.
It is embedded to the middle of the blade into plain rock rising from the floor.

From the roof it is plain to see that the Halo above Acorghas actually centers
on the Temple and not the city.

The priests are mostly local demons, though there are some humans.


Tower Quarter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The area immediately
around the tower is known as the **Tower Quarter** or the **First Quarter**. It is the oldest
quarter, being built even before the Tower itself, to house Abbadon's first Redeemed followers.
Most buildings has been since rebuilt to a more luxurious standard, but some of the original
buildings (and their original inhabitants) still remain.


Red Quarter
~~~~~~~~~~~
This quarter is named for the color of its buildings, which is mostly red and gold- the colors
of Abbadon. It houses mostly Redeemed demons and demon businesses, which are all followers of 
Abbadon and so often flaunt his colors. 

It is placed behind and to the left of the `Tower Quarter`_.


Exiles Quarter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The quarter is named for its demographic, predominantly normal mortals and monsters
that have been exiled to :ref:`Avernus`. This quarter is not as rich as the Red or Tower
quarters, but it is still fairly well put- most of the reputable businesses in the 
city are housed in this quarter. Though some Redeemed demons do live in this quarter, they
tend to be the ones who are less fervent, and more interested in leading "mortal"
lives.

It is placed in the same tier as the `Red Quarter`_, to its right.


Newcomers Quarter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Named so because it houses mostly new demons and mortals that have not found a place in
the other Quarters, this Quarter is more prone to trouble mostly in clashes between new
mortals in the city, and redeemed demons and monsters that the new mortals don't know
how to deal with, and the redeemed in turn are still foreign to civilization.

It is in the next tier to the Red and Exiles quarters, surrounding the `Exiles Quarter`_
completely from behind and sprawling a little to the back side of the `Red Quarter`_.

Farmer's Quarter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Quarter houses mostly livestock, open markets, horses, and small squat buildings
for the caretakers of all of those. 

It is placed behind the `Red Quarter`_, and stretches all the way to the main gate.


The Order
---------

:ref:`Ains Wind, the Swordswoman` is currently in charge in the city. Her objective 
is obviously to get Abbadon's True Blade.

Inns and Taverns
----------------


The Severed Horn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :width: 20%
   :align: center

A reputable inn in the `Exiles Quarter`_, it is owned by a Redeemed Minotaur_ named 
**Hornless Arnus**. 

Arnus was once a normal Minotaur, living with his tribe in the
underground caverns *somewhere*. He led normal Minotaur life, preying on miners and
other passers-by, until at some point his clan became too much of a nuisance and
adventurers and soldiers were sent to eradicate it. Bloodied and running for his life with
one horn broken, Arnus understood for the first time the feelings he caused in 
his prey. He cut off his other horn, and from there sought redemption.

He appears tall and muscular, covered in brown fur. From the sides of his head, above 
his cow-like ears, two horn stumps emerge- The left one has a rough and uneven end, while
the right one is clean-cut.

The sign for his Inn is an X made from two curved horn, one with a straight, clean base, and
one with a rough, uneven base. On the inside there is a large, well-lit common room, with
stairs to the rooms on the upper floor on the right. At the back end of the room there is 
a massive counter, a full meter and a half above the floor, and behind that shelves with bottles
and small caskets. At the top of this cabinet, surrounded to the sides with shelves full of bottles,
There is a big display space, housing a big wooden shield with a big curved horn.

Random People
-------------

Toya and Kylre 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. note:: Inspired by Critical Role, C2E1-4: Small Girl with broken voice adopted by big and scary demon.
          I wrote Hezrou because that's a frog monster like in CR, but for balance reasons a Ceustodaemon might be more appropriate.

**Toya Deepheart** is an orphan dwarven girl about the age of 12. She was exiled with 
her father to Avernus at the age of 6, but he died shortly after fending off a Hezrou_.
Her voice is badly damaged, she sounds hoarse permanently.

**Kylre** (Kyle Ree) is a Hezrou_ and Toya's adoptive father. He was redeemed by caring for Toya after killing 

The story goes thus: Soon after Toya and her father arrived in Avernus, Kylre- at this point not Redeemed- found a tasty meal in them.
Her father fought Kylre and instructed her to run, and so she did, crying all the while,
breaking her voice until it would never heal. After consuming her father, Kylre gave chase, looking to finish 
his meal with a snack- but when he cornered Toya, sitting on the floor with a twisted ankle, her
back to a tree and a monster looming over her, all she could was cry for her father. Encountering this
tiny, crying form, Kylre was puzzled- he decided to save the snack for later. Over the next few months,
Kylre began to redeem himself- always "saving the snack for later", he fed Toya and defended her.
Eventually, he realized he is no longer the demon he once was, and made his way to Acorghas, where
he now lives with Toya.

This make Kylre a 1st generation Redeemed demon, without Abbadon's influence (which should be quite rare).
