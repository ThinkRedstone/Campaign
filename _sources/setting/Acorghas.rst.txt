Acorghas
========

Description
-----------

In abyssal, Acor: Temple, Ghas:  City. Temple City. Other options
for Acor are Redemption, Tower, and Sword.

The first city after :ref:`Nelghas`.
It is built on the edge of the :ref:`Inner Crater`, where :ref:`Abbadon` broke
it and faced :ref:`Naru`, the city built around and slightly into the passage.

The sheer cliff of the Inner Crater is the first thing visible, as well as the
white light above Acorghas. As you get closer, the giant gap in the cliff as
well as the giant white light burning above the city become apparent. In the
middle of the gap in the cliff, stands a giant tower, about half the height of
the cliffs to either side. Above the tower and the cliffs, nearly as big as the
city walls, there is a giant halo made of white flame.

The city is sprawled to the foot of the tower, a complex of stone buildings that
become more and more wooden and provisional as you reach the far side of the
wall.

The wall itself is about half as high as :ref:`Nelghas`'s wall, standing at 5
meters high. It lacks the magical inner working of Nelghas's wall, which means
it is not nearly as wide (about 2 meters wide).

The gates are local wood strengthened with steel, adorned in the middle with 
Abbadon's symbol made of bronze (which also looks like a silhouette of the
city).

Demographic
-----------
The city is composed by about 50% redeemed demons. The rest are exiled mortals,
who have somehow made their way to Acorghas.

The redeemed demons are fervent followers of Abbadon, some of them redeemed by 
his own hand.


The Temple
----------
The tower in the middle of the city is a temple to Abbadon. It hollow inside, 
leaving the central space with a view all the way to the sky. In the middle of
this central hall there is the True Blade of Abbadon, which is a flaming longsword.
It is embedded to the middle of the blade into the floor.

The priests are mostly local demons, though there are some humans.

The Order
---------

:ref:`Ains Wind, the Swordswoman` is currently in charge in the city. Her objective 
is obviously to get Abbadon's True Blade.
