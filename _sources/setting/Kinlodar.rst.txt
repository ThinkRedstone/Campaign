Kinlodar
========

This city serves as the base of operations for The Order, and is ruled by a Greatsword- 
:ref:`Grotrur the Dwarven King`. Most administrative, recruitment, and manufacturing for
the order happens in this city.

Strcture
--------

The city is located on the edge of the **Negrogh Mountains**, where they meet The Ocean. 
It is composed of three giant terraces, fanning out from the side of the mountain and over
The Ocean, forming three tiers connected via staircases and elevators. The city is accessable
mostly via tunnels through the mountains, leading to highland hunting grounds, mountain rivers,
and other dwarven cities. 

Despite the proximity to The Ocean, the city conducts very little trade via seafairing- even the
Low Tier about 200m above sealevel, making the transport of goods to sea difficult, as well
as the maintenance of any sizeable port.

The High Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The High Tier, which is the smallest, is the administrative center of the city- The Palace, 
:ref:`Outrok's <Outrok the Lich>` workshop (de facto central administration for The Order), 
the Kin's Guard headquarters and other important institutes are placed here. Here, 
the demographic is most diverse, as members of the Order as well as merchants from faraway places
mingle with the mostly-dwarven natives.

Architecture is mostly white stone with red tiled roofs, and is mostly for dwarves despite the demographic.

The Middle Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Middle Tier is mostly residential, serving mainly as residence for people working in the High Tier
who don't wish to commute from the Low Tier. It houses high-to-mid income families, but most commercial 
activity is relegated to the Low Tier, with the exception being inns, which flourish due to the influx
of visitors to the city seeking buisness in the High Tier.

The Low Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Low Tier is the lowest and the biggest terrace, divided into three quarters.
