Day 1, Sunday
-------------

Today is the test day in the Wizard's Guild, meaning all the apprentices are
either showing of their work in the Guildhall, or celebrating / drowning their
sorrows in Wendy's or other similar establishments.

**Spark** will summon the party seemingly at random, and ask them to run an
"errand" for him- to discreetly deliver a magical "thing" to the room of an apprentice wizard by the
name of **Bemar Zehe**.

----

The party talked with Spark, efficiently dropped the spellstone on **Bemar Zehe**'s pillow,
and returned to Spark via Wendy's.

They found Spark in his ritual chamber, which is located in the Wizard's Guildhall,
arguing with **Thunder**, where he agreed to:

1. Introduce Luisa to the Deputy from the Mafia.
2. Kill Gecko.
3. Help the case of the missing god.

----

Spark will use `Disintegrate`_ at level 7, modifier +30 to kill Gecko,
and send Luisa at midnight to talk with **The Deputy** of the whispering hand,
at his court on the western side of the Bay ward.

He will concede to Aira that he has no idea where :ref:`Sraqtat` is, but 
if pressed he might know someone with better knowledge (alluding to :ref:`Obelisk`).
