Day 1, Sunday
-------------

Today is the test day in the Wizard's Guild, meaning all the apprentices are
either showing of their work in the Guildhall, or celebrating / drowning their
sorrows in Wendy's or other similar establishments.

**Spark** will summon the party seemingly at random, and ask them to run an
"errand" for him- to discreetly deliver a magical "thing" to the room of an apprentice wizard by the
name of **Bemar Zehe**.

----

The party talked with Spark, efficiently dropped the spellstone on **Bemar Zehe**'s pillow,
and returned to Spark via Wendy's.

They found Spark in his ritual chamber, which is located in the Wizard's Guildhall,
arguing with **Thunder**, where he agreed to:

1. Introduce Luisa to the Deputy from the Mafia.
2. Kill Gecko.
3. Help the case of the missing god.

----

Day 2, Monday
-------------

Spark will use `Disintegrate`_ at level 7, modifier +30 to kill Gecko,
and send Luisa at midnight to talk with **The Deputy** of the Mafia,
at his court on the western side of the Bay ward.

He will concede to Aira that he has no idea where :ref:`Sraqtat` is, but
if pressed he might know someone with better knowledge (alluding to :ref:`Obelisk`).

----

The party talked with **Tudrem Tuskscar**, a priest of :ref:`Etia`, inadvertently giving
him knowledge of Gecko, which he rewarded with knowledge about the guilds, a book about
the history of Sraqtat in about the last 1,000 years, and a book about Dargons and Dargonborn.

----

After the Spark meeting planned for last session, they will probably go to meet with **The Deputy**,
where they will give the Whispering Hand assasins an opportunity to try and kill **The Deputy**.
He will run away, calling out to Luisa and telling her to prove herself against them.

----

After meeting with Spark, they got in their head that :ref:`Adnelis of the Rowan
Tree` might be able to divine a way to kill Gecko. They then met with **The
Deputy**, and assisted **The Whispering Hand**'s assassins in trying to kill
him.

`Deputy Stats <https://monster.pf2.tools/v/Lr3ch9dF-the-deputy>`_

If they're able to kill The Deputy, then the Mafia will take some time to
recover and launch a counter-attack. Otherwise, the Mafia will set goons to
assault them.

Earliest ship to Kinlodar is the GTC-commissioned **Maiden of The Wind**,
captained by human **Nils West**, leaving for Inlenel on *Tuesday evening (Day 3)*,

Next ship is **The Big One**, a smaller vessel, commissioned by **Ceto**, a
wood giant and famed warrior in **The Arena of Perseverance**. Captained by
elven **Ayen of the Coconut Tree**.

----

Day 3, Tuesday
--------------

They killed **The Deputy**, robbed his corpse and the direwolf pelts he
was planning to ship to Kinlodar, and hired the **Maiden** to take them to Kinlodar.
On their way to a book store maybe? The got assualted by Mafia goons.

----

Spark will catch them when next they enter a building. He will tell them Adnelis was working with
a mage named :ref:`Aymer Eilcan`, and that he knows nothing further.

----

Luisa buried Aira in Unnan's Sraqtat Temple. They boarded the **Maiden of The Wind**, where
**Spark** informed them that **Adnelis** was working with a mage named :ref:`Aymer Elican` in Kinlodar.

----

In Inlenel the ship will stop for the day to take on board more water and supplies, letting the party
explore the small city. There they might meet **Kilyn of the Mimosa Tree**, another priest in the temple
of Sraqtat.
