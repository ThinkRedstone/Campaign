In Unnan, day 1.

  Hi heartwood, hope you're doing well!

  We started a new project recently, your father and I are very excited about-
  We're trying to grow wind-chimes out of a willow, to make a singing willow!

  Your father says he can already see your eyes rolling, so I won't bore you
  with any more details.

  If you're at Unnan, drop by Wendy's Bar, near the Wizard's Guildhall. They
  have great elven beers, and your father and I first met there, about 80 years
  ago, so it has family history- though I doubt Wendy still runs the place.

  ~~We miss you~~ We love you very much, and wish you luck in finding your Tree.
  Just, remember to write back every once in a while, okay?

  To our big Luisa,
  Lorsan & Adylen of the Sylen Tree

  P.S. we just sold the Goldenchain Shield to a nice human named Nadum Light,
  so we're adding a little something so you can celebrate! Wendy's always had a
  good selection of harsh dwarven whiskeys, so buy your friends a round!
