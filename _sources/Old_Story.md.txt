# Old Story

## Naru, The Core of the Story
Naru is behind why gods are dying. It was under his guidance that Aton-Ka was
banished to Avernus. It was he who sent Gan Distantshine to massacre Obelisk's 
church in order to weaken him.

## The True Blades
Each of the gods has a True Blade associated 
with it. The blade contains a shard of the 
god's power, and the god can be permanently
removed only using that blade. 

Naru is dancing a complicated dance of trying 
to get all the True Blades of all the gods, 
as well as manipulate all the gods so he could
kill them with their blade.

## Ulla Thorne and the Cycle Aton-Ka
He is a priest of Aton-Ka. An `agent of Naru` banished Aton-Ka to Avernus
together with Ulla in hope of breaking the Aton cycle of Rebirth.

## Grust
His family has carried the True Blade of Behemoth
for generations, unknowingly. He named it Bertha.
Sent to Avernus by a full-plated Agent of Naru.

## Rok'Ta Komt
A dwarven conjurer with Crystal focus. Apparently sent to Avernus because he
experimented with body modification?
Sent by an unknown Agent of Naru.

## Elas Gensalor
A necromancer sent to Avernus for being a necromancer.
The hint suggests he was sent by Sraqtat, maybe
to try and throw chaos into Naru's plan?
