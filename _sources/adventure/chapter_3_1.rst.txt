---------------------

**Vesstan of The Sylen Tree** is an underworld fixer at the :ref:`The Sweltering Revel`.
He has a cigar, a large scar and an eyepatch on his right eye, and a
classic italian mobster attitude.

He will connect the party with **Alilynn Yesra**, a female half-elf from
**Unnan**, previously a member of the **Whispering Hand**, Th'el's gang.
She also has a tattoo on her right hand. She found work with **The Barrel**, 
a smuggler working to smuggle direwolf parts and whole direwolves disguised
in a shipment of beer. He stopped in Unnan and hired more muscle to help
in the last leg of his operations in Kinlodar.

----

**Vesstan** took their gold and is looking for **Alilynn**, he promised to
meet them again at *Evening of Tuesday, 1*. Th'el snuck up on **Lorenzo**, 
arising the latter's suspicion, compounding with Lorenzo's knowledge of Th'els
mysterious interactions with the Order of Blades. Th'el also wanted to
talk with :ref:`Bharmore Noblechest` or :ref:`Aymer Eilcan` regarding magical tattos.

Tuesday, 1
----------

**Lorenzo** will set someone to follow the party (Perception DC19).

.. note::
   Ask Toz how much health he restored to Aurea

The party talked with :ref:`Bhamore Noblechest`, who gave them a 100gp offer for the tattoo 
after the festival (*Saturday, 4*). She also informed them :ref:`Aymer Eilcan` is not in town.


They noticed and subdued The Barrel's agent who tailed them, a human fellow named **Aurea Vincula**
from **Stonevale**. He was employed by The Barrel back at Stonevale and can lead the party back
to were he was told to report, or other locations used by The Barrel.

Lorenzo is not stupid, and considered that his tail might be noticed- which is why he setup an ambush
where he told his tail to report. See :ref:`Barrel Ambush`. 

The ambush will collectively have 32cp, 53sp, 63gp, 1 pair of `Goggles of Night <https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=2879&name=goggles_of_night>`_.
