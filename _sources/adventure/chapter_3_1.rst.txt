Evening of Monday, 0 
---------------------

**Vesstan of The Sylen Tree** is an underworld fixer at the :ref:`The Sweltering Revel`.
He has a cigar, a large scar and an eyepatch on his right eye, and a
classic italian mobster attitude.

He will connect the party with **Alilynn Yesra**, a female half-elf from
**Unnan**, previously a member of the **Whispering Hand**, Th'el's gang.
She also has a tattoo on her right hand. She found work with **The Barrel**, 
a smuggler working to smuggle direwolf parts and whole direwolves disguised
in a shipment of beer. He stopped in Unnan and hired more muscle to help
in the last leg of his operations in Kinlodar.

----

**Vesstan** took their gold and is looking for **Alilynn**, he promised to
meet them again at *Evening of Tuesday, 1*. Th'el snuck up on **Lorenzo**, 
arising the latter's suspicion, compounding with Lorenzo's knowledge of Th'els
mysterious interactions with the Order of Blades. Th'el also wanted to
talk with :ref:`Bharmore Noblechest` or :ref:`Aymer Eilcan` regarding magical tattos.
Th'el also sent a letter to Aton-Ka's church.

Tuesday, 1
----------

**Lorenzo** will set someone to follow the party (Perception DC19).

----

.. note::
   Ask Toz how much health he restored to Aurea

The party talked with :ref:`Bhamore Noblechest`, who gave them a 100gp offer for the tattoo 
after the festival (*Saturday, 4*). She also informed them :ref:`Aymer Eilcan` is not in town.


They noticed and subdued The Barrel's agent who tailed them, a human fellow named **Aurea Vincula**
from **Stonevale**. He was employed by The Barrel back at Stonevale and can lead the party back
to were he was told to report, or other locations used by The Barrel.

Lorenzo is not stupid, and considered that his tail might be noticed- which is why he setup an ambush
where he told his tail to report. See :ref:`Barrel Ambush`. 

The ambush will collectively have:

- 32cp 53sp 63gp
- 1 pair of `Goggles of Night <https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=2879&name=goggles_of_night>`_
- 3 bottles of `Potion of Invisability <https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=2673&name=invisibility_potion>`_

----

The Party have engaged the :ref:`Barrel Ambush`, which they have forced to flee over the rooftops. The ambush might decide
to engage in melee, or flee (perhaps using their invisibility potions) to their warehouse for reinforcements.

**Lumrock Emberbow**, head priest of Aton-Ka, has been notified by Grotrur about the death of Aton-Ka,
and will urgently try to contact Th'el- he will send **Yardin Grayborn** to wait for him in the :ref:`The Leaky Cauldron`.

   Time of Day: Night

   Roll Healing for :ref:`Barrel Ambush`

| Holt tracked the :ref:`Barrel Ambush` back to the Barrel's Warehouse.
| The Party Talked with **Vesstan** and **Alilynn Yesra** and decided to
  reconvene in the :ref:`The Sweltering Revel` at (*Saturday, 4*).
| They then headed to the Barrel's Warehouse.

Inside The Barrel's Warehouse, there will be seven people:

- The three from :ref:`Barrel Ambush`
- `Aurea Vincula <https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=5653&name=burglar>`_
- 3 Hired Guards from :ref:`simple guards`

The Ambush is composed of three people:

- Female Elf Bounty Hunter: **Valrana of the Willow Tree**, which is from Shynore and talks with an accent
- Human Male Sorcerer with Red Dragon Eyes: **Nardid Celad**
- Half-Orc Bounty Hunter: **Wurtguth**

----

The party tried to engage the whole warehouse, and were forced to flee. They've met with **Yardin**, 
who's still waiting for Th'el in :ref:`The Leaky Cauldron`, and will regroup in Aton-Ka's temple.

**Lumrock Emberbow** will be distressed, and will question Th'el regarding how Aton-Ka died.
