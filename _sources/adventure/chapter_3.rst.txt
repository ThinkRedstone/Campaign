Chapter 3: The Blade in Acorghas
================================
The general plot is that :ref:`Ains Wind` is in :ref:`Acorghas` looking to get
Abbadon's true blade in any way she can. The party were sent by :ref:`Sraqtat`
to retrieve the blade themselves, in an effort to delay Naru.

The Yeth Hound Incident
-----------------------
While nearing the city, the party is stalked by 2 Yeth hounds, one with a blue
collar and one with a red collar. They are starving, and follow the party in
hopes for food. The Red collar has the name **Fuzzy** in Abyssal, and the blue
collar has the name **Wuzzy**. On the morning of the sixth day, Lampart should
notice Sraqtat's "P.S." on the scroll.

On the night of the sixth day, the Yeth hounds should approach while the party
is eating, coming from above and walking on the air, looking at the party's
food.

Entering the City
-----------------
When the party approaches, there is a short queue of various demons wanting to
enter the city:

- A few Zebub- Human like in appearance, with claws on their fingers, a sharp
  tail, and mandibles. 
- 2 Munagola_
- 4 Barbazu_

At the gate, two guards stand:

- A female zebub named **Meyar**
- A male Pitfiend_ named **Desper**

Both wearing chainmail and a tabard with the redeemed horns. Armed with a
Longsword each.
Desper remarks that Rok'ta's thunder mace is a very barbaric weapon, and that
he should consider replacing it he want to mingle with well-put people.
