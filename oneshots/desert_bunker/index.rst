Team 32 And The Desert Bunker
=============================

  *THE ONLY UNIVERSAL TRUTH IS DEATH*


Room 1 - Antechamber of Denial
------------------------------

Wall rune: "THE".

Light in this chamber is weaker, going half as far as normal.

The chamber is filled with life-sized statues of various humanoids, smiling
and dancing, except their eyes are closed. There is also a single dragon status, roaring
triumphantly towards the sky, also with its eyes closed.

The shadows of the status stretch into darkness, away from the light.

The trap door at the corner of the room can be pushed open only while it is unseen by everyone
(either due to darkness or because everyone averts their eyes).

Encounter (Moderate)

- Shae
- Shadow
- Greater Shadow Wisp (for extra challange)


Room 2 - Arena of Anger
-----------------------

Wall rune: "ONLY".

The room is dimly lit with red-orange glow, coming from the flames burning
in spots on the floor. The edges of the room are piled high with broken stone fragments,
forming a semi-circular arena in the opposite direction to the stairs.
The stone fragments can be identified (**perception DC15**, **Crafting DC13**)
to be from broken statues.

In the middle of the clearing, there is a large, unmoving humanoid form,
completely enveloped by flames and smoke, with four flaming eye-shaped orbs
floating behind it.

.. note:: 
  Fire Damage: Small fire **2d6**, Large fire **4d6**

Encounter (Moderate)

- 4 flaming eye
- 2 Fire Mephit
- 1 Fire-eye Cyclops Zombie- isn't undead, just acts like a zombie

Room 3 - Bargaining
-------------------

Room 4 - Depression
-------------------


Room 5 - The Hall of Acceptance
-------------------------------

On the walls, the rune reads "IS".

The stairs go down to a square room, with a red carpet going down
the middle, ending in a very large mirror, set in a black frame sunk into the wall.

The carpet is flanked by six status, three on either side, standing on stone daises.
They're all of humanoids, with expression is relief and acceptance, as their hands
hold the handle of the scythe plunged through their chest, the blade sticking out their back.


The Mirror of Vitality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mirror is perfectly reflective, except things which are alive- those appear more hazy
the healthier they are.

.. note::
  | A creature can attempt to pass through the mirror by rolling a wisdom check, **DC20**.
  | If the creature has 75% or more health, they get a -10 status penelty to the check.
  | If the creature has 25% or less health, they get a +5 status bonus to the check.
  | If the creature has zero hit points, it automatically succeeds the check.


Encounter (Severe)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`6 Gargoyles <https://pf2easy.com/?id=3893>`_

4 to start, two more if it's too easy

They can't fly, and their reaction is to the square behind them instead

Room 6 - The Chamber of Death
