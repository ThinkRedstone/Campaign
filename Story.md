Naru is behind why gods are dying. It was under his guidance that Aton-Ka was

church in order to weaken him.

# Ulla Thorne and the Cycle Aton-Ka
He is a priest of Aton-Ka. An `agent of Naru` banished Aton-Ka to Avernus
together with Ulla in hope of breaking the Aton cycle of Rebirth.

experimented with body modification?
