# Random Ideas

## Random prequel idea
Prequel about redeeming Abbadon, and how the suffering he caused convinced Naru
that the only way to truly uphold justice is to remove all the gods.

## Twist Idea: The Party Kills Bell

The party kills Bell Trueflame, which makes Naru understand that even though
mortal are limited in their power, they make good use of it in being cruel and
unjust. 

Naru turns on the world, Abbadon-style, turning into the Punishing Light, the
god of Retribution, and its up to our party and the order of blades to kill him.

## Lush Cave Inspired Area:

A desolate landscape, full of monsters. Possibly a rocky and cracked region,
similar to the Shattered Plains, only cold and full of monsters above ground.
The party gets chased by monsters through it, and find solace in a lush cave,
a solace in their hard travels.

## Tomb of the Dead Soldier

A Tomb to Aton-Ka. Honored by Naru as the tomb for his old friend,
once a soldier, now dead.
