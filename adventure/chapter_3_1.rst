**Vesstan of The Sylen Tree** is an underworld fixer at the :ref:`The Sweltering Revel`.
He has a cigar, a large scar and an eyepatch on his right eye, and a
classic italian mobster attitude.

He will connect the party with **Alilynn Yesra**, a female half-elf from
**Unnan**, previously a member of the **Whispering Hand**, Th'el's gang.
She also has a tatto on her right hand. She found work with **The Barrel**, 
a smuggler working to smuggle direwolf parts and whole direwolves disguised
in a shipment of beer. He stopped in Unnan and hired more muscle to help
in the last leg of his operations in Kinlodar.

**Vesstan** took their gold and is looking for **Alilynn**, he promised to
meet them again at *Evening of Tuesday, 1*. Th'el snuck up on **Lorenzo**, 
arising the latter's suspicion, compounding with Lorenzo's knowledge of Th'els
mysterious interactions with the Order of Blades. Th'el also wanted to
talk with :ref:`Bharmore Noblechest` or :ref:`Aymer Eilcan` regarding magical tattos.
