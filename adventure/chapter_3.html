<h2>The Yeth Hound Incident<a class="headerlink" href="#the-yeth-hound-incident" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>While nearing the city, the party is stalked by 2 Yeth hounds, one with a blue
collar and one with a red collar. They are starving, and follow the party in
hopes for food. The Red collar has the name <strong>Fuzzy</strong> in Abyssal, and the blue
collar has the name <strong>Wuzzy</strong>. On the morning of the sixth day, Lampart should
notice Sraqtat’s “P.S.” on the scroll.</p>
<p>On the night of the sixth day, the Yeth hounds should approach while the party
is eating, coming from above and walking on the air, looking at the party’s
food.</p>
</section>
<section id="entering-the-city">
<h2>Entering the City<a class="headerlink" href="#entering-the-city" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the party approaches, there is a short queue of various demons wanting to
enter the city:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A few Zebub- Human like in appearance, with claws on their fingers, a sharp
tail, and mandibles.</p></li>
<li><p>2 <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1115">Munagola</a></p></li>
<li><p>4 <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=110">Barbazu</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the gate, two guards stand:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A female zebub named <strong>Meyar</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A male <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=114">Pitfiend</a> named <strong>Desper</strong>. Note: Pitfiends will be medium sized,
and will be about 2.5 meters (and not 5 like in the book).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both wearing chainmail and a tabard with the redeemed horns. Armed with a
Longsword each.
Desper remarks that Rok’ta’s thunder mace is a very barbaric weapon, and that
he should consider replacing it he want to mingle with well-put people.</p>

<section id="the-demon-child-looking-for-her-dogs">
<span id="cheka"></span><h2>The Demon Child Looking For Her Dogs<a class="headerlink" href="#the-demon-child-looking-for-her-dogs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the city there is a young female <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=114">Pitfiend</a> child named <strong>Cheka</strong>. Cheka is
visibly much smaller than Desper from the gate- she’s exactly 1.52m, and
her apparent age is 5 in human years. Unlike adult
pit lords, she is a light shade of pink #af6c88, and her horns just poke out of her
hair <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Cheka is looking for her two pet Yeth Hounds, Fuzzy and Wuzzy, that ran away last
week (<a class="reference internal" href="#the-yeth-hound-incident">The Yeth Hound Incident</a>). She asked everywhere and even painted signs,
but she could not find them. She is worried they ran out of the city,
because they’re domesticated and don’t really know how to hunt in nature (though
those are big words for her, she would say she is worried that they aren’t getting
snacks).</p>
<p>Her mother is named <strong>Nakti</strong>, and she is a normal (i.e. tall and red) pit
fiend. Her father is Desper from the gate- he volunteered to take gate duty, so he
could look for the dogs outside the city. They live with Cheka in their house in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#red-quarter"><span class="std std-ref">Red Quarter</span></a>, near the boundary with the <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#exiles-quarter"><span class="std std-ref">Exiles Quarter</span></a>.</p>
<p>She met with Ains in the <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#tower-quarter"><span class="std std-ref">Tower Quarter</span></a>, and Ains promised her that if she found
Cheka’s dogs she would return them. This is a clue to the whereabouts for the Order’s
base of operations in Acorghas.</p>

<aside class="footnote brackets" id="id2" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id1">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>Demons (technically devils as per pathfinder names)  are synthetic magical creatures,
like angles, mostly (only?) created by Abbadon during the Cruel Age, but they can reproduce.
On an unrelated note, Cheka’s colors are not natural for young pit fiends, and are because
she was born Redeemed (similar to that domesticated fox experiment). I would imagine 3rd
and 4th generation Redeemed pit lords would be even lighter in shade, perhaps with silver or white scales
devoid of any red.</p>

<h2>The Ring of a Smithy Calls Home<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ring-of-a-smithy-calls-home" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the city there is a blacksmith named <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#astrog"><span class="std std-ref">Astrog’s Armory</span></a>, which creates magical
protective equipment. He is quite famous, since he is one of the founders of
Acroghas. His shop is also located in the <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#tower-quarter"><span class="std std-ref">Tower Quarter</span></a>, and might be
passed by people coming from the gate. He can be seen by the party making
equipment when they pass by.</p>

<section id="the-true-flame-monument">
<h2>The True Flame Monument<a class="headerlink" href="#the-true-flame-monument" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Order.html#bell-trueflame"><span class="std std-ref">Bell Trueflame</span></a> is present in the city, and upon visiting the Tower, he is guided by one of the priests
to The True Flame Monument. Elas should recognize him, and PCs should be given the opportunity to follow.
A hint can be dropped that he helped <a class="reference internal" href="#cheka"><span class="std std-ref">The Demon Child Looking For Her Dogs</span></a> find her dogs.</p>
<p>At a middle floor of <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#the-tower"><span class="std std-ref">The Temple Tower</span></a>, there is a small dark room branching off the main balcony encircling the hollow center.
This small room contains a life-sized marble <a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroforge.com/load_config%3D502837608/">statue</a> of a smiling woman (<a class="reference internal" href="cruel_age_oneshot.html#lilina-trueflame"><span class="std std-ref">Lilina Trueflame</span></a>) in a simple dress, with an
outstretched hand. The only thing fighting against the darkness in the room is a small orange flame, floating above her
raised hand.</p>
<p>On the pedestal the statue stand on, there is a inscription in Celestial:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the heart of every person burns the need to do good- to give mercy to the poor, justice to the weak, fellowship to the lonely.
For some this fire is dampened to a spark by the cruelty of life; for others, it rises to consume their entire existence.
In every person, this desire rings true- and mortals are made divine by this <strong>Trueflame</strong>.</p>
<p class="attribution">—In Memory of Lilina Trueflame</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At this monument, Bell reads the inscription and ponders the statue bearing his family name. <a class="reference internal" href="../gods.html#abbadon"><span class="std std-ref">Abbadon</span></a> is
waiting in the room, his halo dimmer than the flame, saying in common: “You greatly resemble her.”
Abbadon will apologize for arranging this, saying he couldn’t help but want to meet her remaining blood.
Points of discussion between him and Bell:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>He asks Bell to pass the message that he doesn’t rely on <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#the-temple-tower"><span class="std std-ref">his sword</span></a> any longer, and
Naru can take it back if he wants.</p></li>
<li><p>He will finish by saying “I can see why Naru picked you”.</p></li>

<p>Her party is compromised of herself, and two others:</p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#acorghas-priesthood"><span class="std std-ref">priesthood</span></a> are planning a celebration- two options:</p>

<strong>Enam Nala</strong>, a human male in his 40s which the party met in <a class="reference internal" href="#the-true-flame-monument">The True Flame Monument</a>, has been
chosen by Abbadon to lead the Temple of the Sword, after the previous Head Priest resigned.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The priesthood organized a surprise celebration, and asked Lamart and Bonk to entertain- so now both PCs

<p>The tower is packed with people, its many floors flooded- while Abbadon’s True Blade is sitting uselessly in the slot in ground from which once
a great halo radiated out and over the city. The people are packed wall to wall, scared faces looking towards the
still sword. <strong>Enam Nala</strong>, leader of the <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#acorghas-priesthood"><span class="std std-ref">Priesthood</span></a>, rushes to join the party.</p>
<p>“Well”, Bonk says, “I’m screwed. I haven’t a verse for the occasion.”</p>
<p>Ains instruct Bonk and Bell to stick close- Bell says they can’t leave these people while holding <a class="reference internal" href="#cheka">Cheka</a> close.
Wuzzy is limping behind them both, baring its teeth.</p>
<p>“Cheka is scared”, a faint whisper is heard- “Where’s dad and mom?”</p>
<p>Ains is out of ideas, her mission is clearly failed.</p>
<p>Wounded soldiers stream from the entrance, approaching the wounded <a class="reference internal" href="../setting/Acorghas.html#notable-members-of-the-guard"><span class="std std-ref">Morfir and Kagi</span></a>.
The demons can be heared outside, as the very last remnant of the line is pushed step by step down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>Annor</strong>: “We work to undo our mistake- for we will never be free from them. In the end, all must pay the price for what they did.”</p>
<p>Bell, Cheka and Bonk should react by arguing that Abbadon should intervene- to save the innocent.</p>

<p>At the behest of Cheka, a figure descends from the sky- grey winged, with three horns and a radiant halo, Abbadon
slowly falls from the top of the tower down to the bottom, holding a single long metal spike in his left hand.</p>
<p>The demons stop advancing and cower before their god. In a single beat of his wings, Abbadon reaches the demons,
tearing through them with his spike- his halo blindingly light as its light <em>burns</em> at the demons.
If a flash of white fire, Abbadon disintegrates everything standing in the corridor.</p>
<p>The priests are horrified at the sight of their god, covered in the blood of those he seeks to reedeem.</p>
<p>Outside, the demons can be heared regrouping.</p>
<p>Abbadon monologue:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“My existance has always been defined by obsession. At first it was with fixing broken mortals-
later my revenge, and finally with fixing the results of my previous mistakes. Yet here we are, another
obsession, another mistake. I can see it so clearly now, the path that lead me here- but for the first time,
I can see where I am going, where I need to go.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Abbadon addresses Enam Nala and Annor:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Teach them of Redemption and leniency. Teach them of fixing the mistakes of their past.”
As Abbadon grabs His True Blade, he adds- “But also teach them of not going too far.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As Abbadon stabs the swords through his chest, he and the swords explode to a million
gray sparks, flying out through the walls and the skylight, forming above the city a new
gray halo- flanked by three curved horns, floating above the walls of the city.</p>
<p>In his place, Abbadon leaves a single scroll, in modern celestial, asking for Lilina’s Grave
to be transported to Naru’s Monument to the Gods- so “we can finally rest together.”</p>

<h2>The Great Escape<a class="headerlink" href="#the-great-escape" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ains’s Greatsword can teleport its holder, and anything she is carrying, to an avatar of Naru (which will be conveniently located
at the Monument to the Gods). It cannot transport anything resistent to magic, like True Blades, and she can’t
transport anything she can’t physically lift. She might also be able to return to where she came from.</p>
<p>The party can use this to escape by convincing her to let Annor ferry people over by carrying them.</p>
