<p>Jeles is the capital of <strong>The Empire of Justice and Mercy</strong>, an Theocracy based
around the churches of <a class="reference internal" href="#gaedon">Gaedon</a> (god of mercy) and <a class="reference internal" href="../gods.html#naru"><span class="std std-ref">Naru</span></a> (god of justice), with significant
impact from the churches of the other gods.</p>
<p>The government is supposedly headed by Naru and Gaedon in concert, but in reality the day-to-day
business is ran by the Council of Heads, which is composed of the head priests of all the churches
in the empire. For this reason, the city houses the central leadership for all Churches.</p>

<p>The Brown District itself is full of well-built stone houses painted mostly white. A lot of the
people wear brown, and a lot of Gaedon’s priests live there. At the center of the district stands
<strong>The Halls of Mercy</strong>, the central temple of Gaedon’s church, where he spends most of his time.
The Halls of Mercy is also de facto a hospital, with patients seeking the help of the priests.</p>

<p>She is known as a very kind girl, and has helped a lot of folk in town- especially
those the church has dismissed.</p>
<p>She was an orphan, and her and her brother were taken in by Gaedon’s Church, something
she feels gratitude for to this day.</p>
<p>She works in Gaedon’s Temple as a Nurse, tending to wounded and sick in the halls

<p>The party is sitting in a room in a bad part of town. They have all been summoned by Dayton.
Dayton enters, with his robes marking him as the high priest of <a class="reference internal" href="#gaedon">Gaedon</a>.</p>
<p>He explains to the party that the Church of Gaedon needs a certain woman dead. He doesn’t
care how or who, so long as the woman is dead, he will pay each PC a 100GP, no questions asked.</p>
<p>His only other stipulation is that <strong>no-one</strong> must know that the church is involved.</p>
<p>The woman’s name is <a class="reference internal" href="#lilina-trueflame">Lilina Trueflame</a>, and she can usually be found in <a class="reference internal" href="#the-brown-district">the Brown District</a>,

<p>Lilina is a very well liked, <em>merciful</em> girl. It is known she is usually at the gardens of

<section id="exploring-the-temple-scene">
<h2>Exploring the Temple Scene<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-the-temple-scene" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The temple is quite large, almost a District on its own in terms of size. It is composed of
<strong>The Outer Hall</strong> and <strong>The Inner Hall</strong>, and gardens which occupy the rest of the space.</p>
<section id="outer-hall">
<h3>Outer Hall<a class="headerlink" href="#outer-hall" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Outer Hall also serves as the wall of the temple- it surrounds the perimeter of the temple,
like a small wall, decorated on the outside with banners of the Outstretched Hand. On the inside,
there are large windows throughout the bottom floor that give a view to the outer gardens.
On the upper floors there is probably rooms for the priests, as well as facilities such
as libraries and offices.</p>
</section>
<section id="outer-gardens">
<h3>Outer Gardens<a class="headerlink" href="#outer-gardens" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The outer gardens occupy the space between the inner and outer halls. They are mostly open space,
with grass, some flower beds, and the occasional tree.</p>
</section>
<section id="inner-hall">
<h3>Inner Hall<a class="headerlink" href="#inner-hall" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Inner Hall is structured like the Outer Hall- a large hall surrounding the inner gardens.
Between the two there are the outer gardens. The inner hall contains mostly patient’s rooms,
and can be though of as a sort of hospital.</p>
</section>
<section id="inner-gardens">
<h3>Inner Gardens<a class="headerlink" href="#inner-gardens" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The inner garden is the garden that is encircled by the inner hall, and  is much more segmented than
the outer garden- full of large hedge walls, trees, and winding cobble pathways between large flower beds.
While the garden as a whole is still large, it is built of smaller “chambers” with walls out of hedges or
living fences, and each such chambers feels relatively secluded.</p>
<p>At the very center of the inner garden there is a fountain with a life-sized white marble statue of
Gaedon, complete with a floating marble halo. <em>Lilina can be found here- see next scene</em></p>

<h2>Finding Lilina Scene: Lilina Helping a Blind Patient<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-lilina-scene-lilina-helping-a-blind-patient" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When the temple is searched, Lilina can be found at a small garden with a patient named
<strong>Fon Daraz</strong>. He has bandages over his eyes, and Lilina talks to him about how nice
the birds are and how warm the sun is. If let on, she will also mention how <a class="reference internal" href="../gods.html#naru"><span class="std std-ref">Naru</span></a>
is blind, and so Fon should take example from him.</p>
<p>Fon Daraz himself is also a <a class="reference internal" href="#a-wounded-paladin-of-naru">Combat Encounter</a>. His background is that he is a Paladin
for the god of Justice, Naru, who was permanently blinded in combat- he is quite depressed
by the notion he will never be able to fight for justice again.</p>
</section>
<section id="last-scene-gaedon-s-rage">
<h2>Last Scene: Gaedon’s Rage<a class="headerlink" href="#last-scene-gaedon-s-rage" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>After Lilina is killed, Gaedon rushes to her side. When he sees her up close,
he falls to his knees in disbelief.</p>
<p>Behind him <a class="reference internal" href="#dayton-nadam">Dayton Nadam</a> hurries to his side, mumbling about who could have
wanted this.</p>
<p>Feathers than begin to fall from his wings, and will continue to fall throughout, revealing
black skin underneath.</p>
<p>He then gently closes her eyes before standing up. He will than zone in on a pc with metal armor,
and fly at them, grabbing them, lifting them off the ground, and asking them:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbwCVXjAHaclGral-SCPnr_S0AHWI2pZg">“Why?”</a></p>
<p>Upon receiving an answer, he will throw the PC, tearing away the front of their armor.
In his next turn, his halo will flow to the armor and he will use it to melt it to the shape
of a sword.</p>
<p>He will than proceed to massacre the PCs, starting with Dayton if relevant.</p>
<p>Dayton will say with his dying breaths:</p>
<p>“She distracted you from our mission… To be with her, you left the sick…
You betrayed those who…” and then Gaedon cuts off his head.</p>
