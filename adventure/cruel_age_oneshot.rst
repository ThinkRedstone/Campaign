Dawn of The Cruel Age
=====================

Background
----------
This whole story happens before the Cruel Age, and in the end Lilina should be dead
and Gaedon transformed into :ref:`Abbadon`, marking the dawn of the Cruel Age.

Jeles

Jeles is the capital of **The Empire of Justice and Mercy**, an Theocracy based
around the churches of Gaedon_ (god of mercy) and :ref:`Naru` (god of justice), with significant 
impact from the churches of the other gods.

The government is supposedly headed by Naru and Gaedon in concert, but in reality the day-to-day 
business is ran by the Council of Heads, which is composed of the head priests of all the churches
in the empire. For this reason, the city houses the central leadership for all Churches.

Gaedon

Gaedon is the god of mercy- he heals the sick and feeds the poor. 
In recent times, he has fallen in love with `Lilina Trueflame`_.

**Appearance**: A handsome man around 27 years old, about 2 meters high, with black hair
and blue eyes. Has two white, feathered wings, and a white flaming halo above his head.

**Colors**: Brown and White.

**Symbol**: An outstretched hand.

Lilina Trueflame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A young woman aged about 25. She has a blond, almost white hair, and brown eyes
with a dark-red tint. 

She is known as a very kind girl, and has helped a lot of folk in town- especially 
those the church has dismissed. 

She was an orphan, and her and her brother were taken in by Gaedon's Church, something
she feels gratitude for to this day.

Dayton Nadam
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Head Priest for the Church of Merciful Gaedon, one of the biggest and most powerful 
churches in `Jeles`_. He is very worried about the stability of the Empire, and the political
game in the Council of Heads.

**Apearance**: A chubby old man with white hair and beard, he wears a brown tunic with 
golden stripes at the base and the end of the cuffs.

Opening Scene: Dayton gives a Quest
-----------------------------------

The party is sitting in a room in a bad part of town. They have all been summoned by Dayton.
Dayton enters, with his robes marking him as the high priest of Gaedon_.

He explains to the party that the Church of Gaedon needs a certain woman dead. He doesn't 
care how or who, so long as the woman is dead, he will pay each PC a 100GP, no questions asked.

His only other stipulation is that **no-one** must know that the church is involved.

The woman's name is `Lilina Trueflame`_, and she can usually be found in the **Brown District**,
the city district in which the main temple to Gaedon is located (the temple's name is **The Hall of 
Mercy**).

Last Scene: Gaedon's Rage
-------------------------

After Lilina is killed, Gaedon rushes to her side. When he sees her up close, 
he falls to his knees in disbelief.

Behind him `Dayton Nadam`_ hurries to his side, mumbling about who could have
wanted this.

Feathers than begin to fall from his wings, and will continue to fall throughout, revealing
black skin underneath.

He then gently closes her eyes before standing up. He will than zone in on a pc with metal armor,
and fly at them, grabbing them, lifting them off the ground, and asking them:

"Why did you do this? Who shares responsibility, mortal?"

Upon receiving an answer, he will punch the PC, tearing away the front of their armor.
In his next turn, his halo will flow to the armor and he will use it to melt it to the shape
of a sword.

He will than proceed to massacre the PCs, starting with Dayton if relevant.
