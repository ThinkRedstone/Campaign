Chapter 3: The Blade in Acorghas
================================
The general plot is that :ref:`Ains Wind` is in :ref:`Acorghas` looking to get
Abbadon's true blade in any way she can. The party were sent by :ref:`Sraqtat`
to retrieve the blade themselves, in an effort to delay Naru.

The Yeth Hound Incident
-----------------------
While nearing the city, the party is stalked by 2 Yeth hounds, one with a blue
collar and one with a red collar. They are starving, and follow the party in
hopes for food. The Red collar has the name **Fuzzy** in Abyssal, and the blue
collar has the name **Wuzzy**. On the morning of the sixth day, Lampart should
notice Sraqtat's "P.S." on the scroll.

On the night of the sixth day, the Yeth hounds should approach while the party
is eating, coming from above and walking on the air, looking at the party's
food.

Entering the City
-----------------
When the party approaches, there is a short queue of various demons wanting to
enter the city:

- A few Zebub- Human like in appearance, with claws on their fingers, a sharp
  tail, and mandibles. 
- 2 Munagola_
- 4 Barbazu_

At the gate, two guards stand:

- A female zebub named **Meyar**
- A male Pitfiend_ named **Desper**. Note: Pitfiends will be medium sized, 
  and will be about 2.5 meters (and not 5 like in the book).

Both wearing chainmail and a tabard with the redeemed horns. Armed with a
Longsword each.
Desper remarks that Rok'ta's thunder mace is a very barbaric weapon, and that
he should consider replacing it he want to mingle with well-put people.

The Demon Child Looking For Her Dogs
------------------------------------
In the city there is a young female Pitfiend_ child named **Cheka**. Cheka is
visibly much smaller than Desper from the gate- she's exactly 1.52m, and
her apparent age is 5 in human years. Unlike adult
pit lords, she is a light shade of pink #af6c88, and her horns just poke out of her
hair [#]_. 

Cheka is looking for her two pet Yeth Hounds, Fuzzy and Wuzzy, that ran away last
week (`The Yeth Hound Incident`_). She asked everywhere and even painted signs,
but she could not find them. She is worried they ran out of the city, 
because they're domesticated and don't really know how to hunt in nature (though 
those are big words for her, she would say she is worried that they aren't getting
snacks).

Her mother is named **Nakti**, and she is a normal (i.e. tall and red) pit 
fiend. Her father is Desper from the gate- he volunteered to take gate duty, so he 
could look for the dogs outside the city. They live with Cheka in their house in the
:ref:`Red Quarter`, near the boundary with the :ref:`Exiles Quarter`.

She met with Ains in the :ref:`Tower Quarter`, and Ains promised her that if she found
Cheka's dogs she would return them. This is a clue to the whereabouts for the Order's
base of operations in Acorghas.


.. [#] Demons (technically devils as per pathfinder names)  are synthetic magical creatures,
   like angles, mostly (only?) created by Abbadon during the Cruel Age, but they can reproduce.
   On an unrelated note, Cheka's colors are not natural for young pit fiends, and are because
   she was born Redeemed (similar to that domesticated fox experiment). I would imagine 3rd 
   and 4th Redeemed pit lords would be even lighter in shade, perhaps with silver or white scales
   devoid of any red.
