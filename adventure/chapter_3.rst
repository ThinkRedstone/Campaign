Chapter 3: The Blade in Acorghas
================================
The general plot is that :ref:`Ains` Wind is in :ref:`Acorghas` looking to get
Abbadon's true blade in any way she can. The party were sent by :ref:`Sraqtat`
to retrieve the blade themselves, in an effort to delay Naru.

Statistics 
-----------

Remaining Treasure Budget: 300 gp

`Necklace of Fireballs <https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=2890&name=necklace_of_fireballs>`_: 44 gp

The Yeth Hound Incident
-----------------------
While nearing the city, the party is stalked by 2 Yeth hounds, one with a blue
collar and one with a red collar. They are starving, and follow the party in
hopes for food. The Red collar has the name **Fuzzy** in Abyssal, and the blue
collar has the name **Wuzzy**. On the morning of the sixth day, Lampart should
notice Sraqtat's "P.S." on the scroll.

On the night of the sixth day, the Yeth hounds should approach while the party
is eating, coming from above and walking on the air, looking at the party's
food.

Entering the City
-----------------
When the party approaches, there is a short queue of various demons wanting to
enter the city:

- A few Zebub- Human like in appearance, with claws on their fingers, a sharp
  tail, and mandibles. 
- 2 Munagola_
- 4 Barbazu_

At the gate, two guards stand:

- A female zebub named **Meyar**
- A male Pitfiend_ named **Desper**. Note: Pitfiends will be medium sized, 
  and will be about 2.5 meters (and not 5 like in the book).

Both wearing chainmail and a tabard with the redeemed horns. Armed with a
Longsword each.
Desper remarks that Rok'ta's thunder mace is a very barbaric weapon, and that
he should consider replacing it he want to mingle with well-put people.

.. _Cheka:

The Demon Child Looking For Her Dogs
------------------------------------
In the city there is a young female Pitfiend_ child named **Cheka**. Cheka is
visibly much smaller than Desper from the gate- she's exactly 1.52m, and
her apparent age is 5 in human years. Unlike adult
pit lords, she is a light shade of pink #af6c88, and her horns just poke out of her
hair [#]_. 

Cheka is looking for her two pet Yeth Hounds, Fuzzy and Wuzzy, that ran away last
week (`The Yeth Hound Incident`_). She asked everywhere and even painted signs,
but she could not find them. She is worried they ran out of the city, 
because they're domesticated and don't really know how to hunt in nature (though 
those are big words for her, she would say she is worried that they aren't getting
snacks).

Her mother is named **Nakti**, and she is a normal (i.e. tall and red) pit 
fiend. Her father is Desper from the gate- he volunteered to take gate duty, so he 
could look for the dogs outside the city. They live with Cheka in their house in the
:ref:`Red Quarter`, near the boundary with the :ref:`Exiles Quarter`.

She met with Ains in the :ref:`Tower Quarter`, and Ains promised her that if she found
Cheka's dogs she would return them. This is a clue to the whereabouts for the Order's
base of operations in Acorghas.


.. [#] Demons (technically devils as per pathfinder names)  are synthetic magical creatures,
   like angles, mostly (only?) created by Abbadon during the Cruel Age, but they can reproduce.
   On an unrelated note, Cheka's colors are not natural for young pit fiends, and are because
   she was born Redeemed (similar to that domesticated fox experiment). I would imagine 3rd 
   and 4th generation Redeemed pit lords would be even lighter in shade, perhaps with silver or white scales
   devoid of any red.

The Ring of a Smithy Calls Home
-------------------------------
In the city there is a blacksmith named :ref:`Astrog`, which creates magical
protective equipment. He is quite famous, since he is one of the founders of
Acroghas. His shop is also located in the :ref:`Tower Quarter`, and might be
passed by people coming from the gate. He can be seen by the party making
equipment when they pass by.

The True Flame Monument
-----------------------

:ref:`Bell Trueflame` is present in the city, and upon visiting the Tower, he is guided by one of the priests
to The True Flame Monument. Elas should recognize him, and PCs should be given the opportunity to follow.
A hint can be dropped that he helped :ref:`Cheka` find her dogs.

At a middle floor of :ref:`The Tower`, there is a small dark room branching off the main balcony encircling the hollow center.
This small room contains a life-sized marble statue_ of a smiling woman (:ref:`Lilina Trueflame`) in a simple dress, with an 
outstretched hand. The only thing fighting against the darkness in the room is a small orange flame, floating above her
raised hand.

On the pedestal the statue stand on, there is a inscription in Celestial:

  In the heart of every person burns the need to do good- to give mercy to the poor, justice to the weak, fellowship to the lonely.
  For some this fire is dampened to a spark by the cruelty of life; for others, it rises to consume their entire existence.
  In every person, this desire rings true- and mortals are made divine by this **Trueflame**.

  -- In Memory of Lilina Trueflame

At this monument, Bell reads the inscription and ponders the statue bearing his family name. :ref:`Abbadon` is 
waiting in the room, his halo dimmer than the flame, saying in common: "You greatly resemble her."
Abbadon will apologize for arranging this, saying he couldn't help but want to meet her remaining blood.
Points of discussion between him and Bell:

  - He asks Bell to pass the message that he doesn't rely on :ref:`his sword <The Temple Tower>` any longer, and 
    Naru can take it back if he wants.
  - He will finish by saying "I can see why Naru picked you".  

The Heist
---------

:ref:`Ains` is in the city with her party (see also :ref:`Order in Acorghas`).

Her party is compromised of herself, and two others:

* Dwarf Magic Items Specialist - Gyrd Shieldshout
* Charming Goblin Bard - Bonk the Bard

The :ref:`priesthood <Acorghas priesthood>` are planning a celebration- two options:

* retcon that there is a festival marking the date Abbadon was Redeemed.
* A priest is choosen to lead the temple
  **Enam Nala**, a human male in his 40s which the party met in `The True Flame Monument`_, has been
  chosen by Abbadon to lead the Temple of the Sword, after the previous Head Priest resigned.

The priesthood organized a suprise celebration, and asked Lamart and Bonk to entertain- so now both PCs
and Ains are planning to use their bard as a distraction while the rest of their respective parties heist the sword.
