<h3>Scene 1: Start<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-1-start" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><em>Aton-ka</em>, appearing as an old elf, is standing and looking away.</p>
<p>He <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tells</span> <span class="pre">some</span> <span class="pre">info</span></code>, and then dies and disintegrates.
“We are surrounded by death. Seek Nelghas, where death is the least imminent”
“I cannot help you, children, for I cannot delay the natural process. But I wish
you all to live what you are given to the fullest, and pass on.”</p>
<p>He points party to Nelghas.</p>
<p>They reach Nelghas.</p>

<p>In Nelghas the guards tell them to talk with Gan Distantshine.</p>
<p>Distantshine is helping unload a wagon near a storage room.
He has a proposition- he want the party to kill a devil that
has infiltrated Nelghas, in exchange for favour.</p>
<p>This is where a religion / history check might arouse suspicion.</p>
<p>Either they research him, or they kill the Zebub before he fights with Gan
Distantshine.</p>

<h3>Scene 3: Peyton the Jester at the Laughing Snake<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-3-peyton-the-jester-at-the-laughing-snake" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The oldest person in town is the dwarf Peyton the Jester,
which runs the only apothecary.</p>
<p>He was a bandit that unfortunately robbed a
convoy headed by high ranking priest,
and his whole gang got here.
He remembers that when Gal arrived,
he was sprayed in blood, and carried a
large emblem depicting a setting golden sun
(symbol of obelisk), also bloodied.</p>

<h3>Side note: A message from Aton-Ka<a class="headerlink" href="#side-note-a-message-from-aton-ka" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Ulla feels his holy symbol grow hot. When praying for guidance with it, he
would get the following message: “The Demonic Domains house no innocents. The light might appear
righteous, but it is blinding.”</p>
</section>
<section id="scene-4-the-search-for-the-demon">
<h3>Scene 4: The search for the Demon<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-4-the-search-for-the-demon" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The dead barman is <em>Broldon Moltenflower</em>. He died shortly before the party
arrived. He was found in the building he called home by Aya, which is his
sister. His body was taken, and Gan should know where it is. There is a two-tier
system here, where a very high medicine check should reveal that he died from a
sword wound in the back, and then someone made it appear like he was ravaged by
claws. A lower roll will only tell them about the claw marks.</p>
<p>Aya never saw the claw marks, since Gan added them after he got custody of the
body. She also knows he was a devoted follower of Obelisk- a priest magician.
When pressed, she might remember that he behaved weirdly before he was killed-
he was greatly disturbed by something.</p>
<p>Inside Broldon’s house, you can use detect magic to find the remnants of some
magic has been cast. A letter under a loose tile reads: “You know how dangerous
he is. You know what he has done. We implore you, use your talents and rid the
world of his presence. All things must end, and his time has passed.” It is
signed with the symbol of Obelisk. There are also some components that a
religion check will verify are part of a summoning ritual.</p>

<section id="scene-5-stanford-is-killed">
<h3>Scene 5: Stanford is Killed<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-5-stanford-is-killed" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Stanford, the half-elf guard which is good with the crossbow, is killed by the
demon while guarding Gan’s house.</p>
<p>When the party arrives, Gan is with Jarod, Peyton, and 5 guards, outside his
house. He does not look worried, or sad- this is all a ploy to keep the party
here for long enough for Gan to assemble the manpower to steal Bertha.
Jarod is worried- having one of his subordinates die inside the walls is new.</p>
<p>Stanford is found dead on the roof of Gan’s house, with large bite marks on his arms
and shoulders. His crossbow lays discarded and uncocked, his sword half-out its
scabbard. He is surrounded by his own blood, but little drops of black blood can
be found near him, forming a trail going over the side of the building.</p>
<p>Following the trail leads to a seemingly empty building, where the Zebub is
hiding and invisible. It will use message to ask if the killer (meaning Gan)
sent the party. Answering with Gan’s name or “yes” will cause it to attack the party.</p>
<p>The Zebub knows that Gan killed Broldon, and that it is tasked with killing Gan,
and “his constrictors”.</p>

<section id="scene-6-bertha-is-taken">
<h3>Scene 6: Bertha is Taken<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-6-bertha-is-taken" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Everyone returns to Gan’s house, which has a large Scale as a centerpiece.
He thanks the party, and shares information: Avernus can be existed only through
the middle.
He then turns his back on the party and ties on a blindfold. He tells the party
that he personally wishes them well, but justice must be blind. He simultaneously lifts
the shield, and removes its cover to reveal Naru’s Halo of Blades.</p>
<p>On his queue, x guards storm out of the doors shouting “In the name of Blind
Justice”. He would try to get to Grust, at which point he would grapple with
him and when touching Bertha disappear in a flash of light.</p>

<h3>Scene x-1: The shadows are afraid<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-x-1-the-shadows-are-afraid" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>When travelling the great expanse of grass on the plains center-ward from Nelghas, the shadows slowly
gather more and more delay when moving in a specific direction.</p>
</section>
<section id="scene-x-naru-killing-aton-ka">
<h3>Scene x: Naru killing Aton-ka<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-x-naru-killing-aton-ka" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Naru is sitting on a rock at the side of the road, with Aton-ka’s True Blade across his lap,
and his halo of weapons all thrown on the ground around him. The shadows of all players point
away from him. Play “A Call to Arms” here. He apologizes for Gan’s behaviour,
saying that “Some of my followers are too zealous, and sometimes forget that
although our mission justifies the means, we should always use only the justest
means required”.</p>
<p>He stands up and all of his weapons rise from the ground into the air into the
Halo of Blades.
Behind him, 9 greatswords fall from the sky into the ground. In flashes of light,
figures in white robes or armour appear, with the Halo of Blades on their chest.
Orpip is wearing Isoi’s dagger.</p>
<p>Naru: “I am sure you are confused. I am Naru, the Blinding Light.
I’ve come to exact Retribution in the name of Justice.”</p>
<p>Bla bla bla, Naru avoids spoiling the entire story, Th’el notices the dagger.</p>
<p>Naru calls upon Urian to stand witness <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">maybe</span> <span class="pre">call</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">crimes?</span></code>.</p>
<p>Naru explains this isn’t a trial, and what must be done will be done- but he
will allow his old friend these last dignities- to die standing, and defending
himself. Nimrod can now play Aton-ka through Ula.</p>
<p>Naru cleaves Ula’s symbol in half with the hatchet, and everybody feels as their
world loses a god- “You feel your connection with your church loosen- the pride
you feel in continuing the traditions and belief carried by your church is
lessened”</p>
<p>Naru: “Now for the other matter. You carry with you something I need. I cannot
let you go with it in your possession.”</p>
<p>He either takes Bertha or attaches Bell to the party to watch over them (and
secretly to give him more experience with the world).
Or he uses plot device magic to set a timer.</p>
