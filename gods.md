# Gods

## Aton-ka

The god of rebirth. Dies just at the start. Connected to Nimrod's PC.
Gets old, dies, and is reborn. Was sent to Avernus by Naru when
dying to hopefully stop him from being reborn.

Symbol: hourglass with an infant and a skull in the dais

Current form: Dying old elf

True Blade: An unornate hatchet.

## Abbadon

The god of Hope and Redemption. A fallen archangel risen again.
Used to be Gaedon, the god of Mercy. 
Fallen and turned into the god of cruelty,
risen again as the god of Hope and Redemption.
Symbol: three horns and a halo.

Appearance : a tall figure, with three blood red horns, black feathered wings, and a glowing halo.

## Behemoth

The chaotic evil god of nature. All about nature defeating man and overthrowing
civilization. Cities will be overgrown, ships lost in storms, fields ravaged
by pests, livestock hunted.

True Blade: Two Handed Orcish Waraxe nicknamed Bertha.

## Obelisk

The lawful neutral god of dying light. About the gentle end of things, the light
of the setting sun.
Maybe: He is a "little brother" figure to Naru, which views him in a gentler
light compared to the other gods.

Symbol: A crescent turned on its side to look like the setting sun.

## Sraqtat

The lawful good Spider God of Fate. He strings a web connecting all, and gently 
tugs the strings to lead to favourable outcomes.

Symbol: A golden spider web.
Appearance: A normal sized golden spider.

## Isoi
The goddess of coin, and those who worship it. Patron
of the merchants who rob you by day, and the 
thieves who steal from you by night.

Symbol: A coin with the imprint of a smiling maiden.

True Blade: A dagger with a silver blade and a golden handle, with a golden
coin imprinted on the base of the blade. Currently in possession of Naru, after
Th'el and his gang stole it from Isoi's church and sold it. 

## Naru

The God of Blinding Light. The very icon of righteousness. He is the light
that burns away the darkness. He is trying to kill all other gods for their
crimes against the world. He believes that so long as the gods are left alive,
they will cause the world to suffer. 

"The Light that Blinds Justice"

Alignment: Lawful Good
Theme: https://youtu.be/qXVmZuPOzU0
Symbol: Swords arranged in a circle to form a sun.

## Edon

The *God of Unity*. He will unite all of mortal kind. And with Naru's recent
aggression, he will do it by the sword if he has to.

He is also called the *God of Chains*, referencing the metaphorical chains that bind
mortal societies.

True Blade: Shortsword, whereabouts undecided, potentially in the hands of his
champion.
Appearance: A human of average height, with wide shoulders, short black hair,
and brown eyes. He looks to be in his late 20s. His chest and arms are covered
with silver burn scars- he got them restraining Abbadon while casting the ritual
to banish him to Avernus.

### Edon Powers
Edon has a spectral chain going from him to each of his close followers, one for each.
The chains catch incoming attacks on Edon, the damage of the attack is inflicted on the
person the chain is attached to; If the attack would kill that person, the chains break
as that person dies.

Edon can use chains to bolster his actions- for example when banishing Abbadon and his
host to Avernus, he wrapped the chains of all of his followers around his sword to bolster
the spell with everything he had.
Bolstering his actions in such a way takes a toll on the attached person, potentially
breaking the chain and killing the person. In the previous example, all the chains broke-
none of the participating followers survived the spell.

## Etia

The *Goddess of Safekeeping*. She preaches to find, collect and preserve that
which otherwise will be no more. This is not strictly gold and jewels, but
anything and everything which is rare and worth saving. 

### Etia as Nott
Possible variation is that Etia is a female goblin, and a compulsive collector
like Nott. When she sees something she wishes to collect, she just does what
ever she needs to to add it to her collection. In this variation, she is less
regal and more child-like, and her priests are less collector by themselves and
more her enablers. 

True Blade: Shears, in a safe in her head priest's personal collection. Probably
subject to change.

## Arca

The *Goddess of the Unyielding*, Arca teaches her followers to pursue what they
believe at any cost and bow to nothing. Her believers founded The Arena of
Perseverance, in which you win only by your opponent surrendering- you do not
win even by his death. The Champion of this Arena traditionally hold her True
Blade, a Glaive named _The Unyielding Blade?_.
