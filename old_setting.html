<h1>Old Setting<a class="headerlink" href="#old-setting" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Getting out of the nine demonic domains is difficult.</p>
<p>Avernus is the lowest, least desirable of the nine domain- the furthest from the
Normal plane. To get to the Normal plane, you need to break through the barrier
separating you current domain from the one above it, until you reach the last
domain and break through to the Normal Plane.</p>
<section id="avernus">
<h2>Avernus<a class="headerlink" href="#avernus" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>First level of the nine demonic domains, and the most populated.
Also known as the Crater of Damned Souls. Or just “The Crater”.</p>
<p>When the gods don’t like you, they kill you. But if they <em>really</em> don’t like you,
in a world in which death is not as permanent as it should be, they instead
dump you in the most hostile and inescapable place in the planes of creation:
Avernus.</p>
<section id="appearance">
<h3>Appearance<a class="headerlink" href="#appearance" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The ground is mostly black. The whole area is gently sloping down like a giant
crater. There are a lot of rivers, not all are water. Most of the flora is in
shades of dark red.</p>
</section>
<section id="getting-out">
<h3>Getting Out<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-out" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In the middle of Avernus there is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thing</span></code>, which leads to the next domain.
It might be cool to have each domain end in some sort of psychological
challenge.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="city-of-nelghas">
<h2>City of Nelghas<a class="headerlink" href="#city-of-nelghas" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A big city, surrounded by walls, on the edge of a cliff. It is one the few bastions of sanity in
Avernus, on the outskirts of the level- as far from the pass as you reasonably
get. It houses mostly damned souls, looking for solace in their last days.</p>
<p>The city is sparsely populated in comparison to its size.
The walls are much thicker than is usual, and surround the city from all
directions- including the sheer cliff at the very edge.</p>
<p>Below the cliff, there are rolling hills. Grain and a little livestock is
cultivated at the base of the cliff, under guard. There is a passage there
from near the city, outside the walls.</p>
<p>The most common threat is that of demons and devils, mostly mindless variants,
which stalk the region as a whole.</p>
<section id="leader-gan-distantshine">
<h3>Leader: Gan Distantshine<a class="headerlink" href="#leader-gan-distantshine" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Elf, damned to Avernus because he massacred the most of the Church of Obelisk,
about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span> <span class="pre">time</span></code> ago. This led to Obelisk personally arriving in the Normal
Plane, which is a very rare occasion since he generally doesn’t intervene, much
less so punish.
For the most part, no one knows this.</p>
<p>Considered a very capable leader, he leads Nelgahs through the chaos in Avernus.</p>
<p>Punishing him curries favour with Obelisk.</p>
<p>A follower of Naru, he massacred the church in the name of justice- To delay
Obelisk and prevent him from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">something</span> <span class="pre">related</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">True</span> <span class="pre">Blade</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Obelisk</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-broken-window">
<h3>The Broken Window<a class="headerlink" href="#the-broken-window" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Located to the right of the main street which extends outside the gatehouse.</p>
<p>The only tavern at Nelgahs. Owned by hot-headed <em>Lewis</em>.</p>
<p>Current barmaid is <em>Aya Korem</em>, a meter sixty and then some, green eyes and
almost-black hair. She is unsettled by how the previous barman lost his life,
but she is desperate for the job- Broldon was like a brother to her, and without
him she has no one to turn to. Lewis offred her the job because he thought it
might help her cope with the loss.</p>
<p>Previous barman is <em>Broldon Moltenflower</em>, a Dwarf, which died in an uncertain way, Gan
claiming the hands of a Demon which infiltrated Nelgahs. He considers himself
a Brother to Aya, and she considers him the same, even though they are not
related by blood. He was a bandit, and took Aya in after her parents died
in a raid (they were both also bandits with his party). He and Aya were thrown
to Avernus because they (and their party) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">did</span> <span class="pre">something</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">offend</span> <span class="pre">Aton-Ka</span></code>.</p>
